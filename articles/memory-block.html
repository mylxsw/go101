<h1>Memory Blocks</h1>

<p>
Go is a language which supports automatic memory management, such as memory allocation and garbage collection.
So Go programmers can do programming without handling the underlying memory management.
This saves Go programmers lots of time.
</p>

<p>
Although knowing the underlying memory management implementation details is not necessary
for Go programmers to write Go code, understanding some concepts and being aware of some facts
in the memory management implementation by the standard Go compiler and runtime is very
helpful for Go programmers to write high quality Go code.
</p>

<p>
This article will explain some concepts and facts of memory block allocation
and garbage collection by the standard Go compiler and runtime.
Other aspects, such as memory apply and memory release in memory management,
will not be touched in this article.

<h3>Memory Blocks</h3>

<p>
A memory block is a continuous memory segment to host
<a href="value-part.html">value parts</a> at run time.
Different memory blocks may have different sizes, to host different value parts.
One memory block may host multiple value parts at the same time,
but each value part can only be hosted within one memory block,
no matter how large the size of that value part is.
In other words, for any value part, it never crosses memory blocks.
</p>

<div>
There are many reasons when one memory block may host multiple value parts. Some of them:
<ul>
<li>
	struct values often have several fields, so when a memory block is allocated for
	a struct value, the memory block will also host these field values.
</li>
<li>
	array values often have many elements, so when a memory block is allocated for
	a array value, the memory block will also host the array element values.
</li>
<li>
	the underlying element sequences of two slices may be hosted on the same memory block,
	the two element sequences even can overlap with each other.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>A Value References The Memory Block It Is Hosted On</h3>

<p>
I have known that a value part can reference another value part.
Here, we extend the definition by saying
a memory block is referenced by all the value parts it hosts.
So if a value part <code>v</code> is referenced by another value part,
then the other value will also reference the memory block hosting <code>v</code>, indirectly.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="when-to-allocate"></p>
<h3>When Will Memory Blocks Be Allocated?</h3>

<div>
In Go, memory blocks may be allocated but not limited at following situations:
<ul>
<li>
	explicitly call the <code>new</code> and <code>make</code> built-in functions.
	A <code>make</code> call will allocate more than one memory blocks to host
	the direct part and underlying part(s) of the created map, slice or channel value.
</li>
<li>
	create maps, slices and anonymous functions with corresponding composite literals.
	More than one memory blocks may be allocated in each of the processes.
</li>
<li>
	declare variables.
	Depends on variable value types, one or more memory blocks may be allocated in each declaration.
</li>
<li>
	assign non-interface values to interface values
	(when the non-interface value is not a pointer value).
</li>
<li>
	concatenate strings.
</li>
<li>
	convert strings to byte or rune slices, and vice versa
	(except <a href="string.html#conversion-optimizations">some special compiler optimization cases</a>).
</li>
<li>
	convert integers to <code>string</code>.
</li>
<li>
	call <code>append</code> function (when the capacity of the base slice is not large enough).
</li>
<li>
	add new key-element pairs into maps (when the underlying hash table needs to be resized).
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Where Will Memory Blocks Be Allocated?</h3>

<p>
For the standard Go compiler and runtime, in every Go program,
each goroutine will maintain a stack, a memory region, at run time.
The initial stack size of each goroutine is small.
The stack size will grow and shrink as needed.
</p>

<p><i>
(Please note, for the standard Go compiler, there is a limit of stack size
each goroutine can has. Ar present, Go 1.11, the default maximum stack size
is 1 GB on 64-bit systems, and 250 MB on 32-bit systems.
We can call the <code>SetMaxStack</code> function in the
<code>runtime/debug</code> standard package to change the size.)
</i></p>

<p>
Memory blocks allocated on the stack of a goroutine can only be used (referenced)
in the goroutine internally.
They are goroutine localized resources.
They are not safe to be referenced crossing goroutines.
A goroutine can access a memory block allocated on the stack of the goroutine
without using any data synchronization techniques.
</p>

<p>
Heap is a singleton in each program.
Memory blocks allocated on heap can be accessed by multiple goroutines.
In other words, they can be accessed concurrently.
Their assessments should be synchronized when needed.
</p>

<p>
Heap is a conservative place to register memory blocks.
If compilers detect a memory block will be referenced crossing goroutines
or can't easily confirm whether or not the memory block is safe to be put on stacks,
then the memory block will be allocated on heap at run time.
This means some values can be safely allocated on stacks may be also allocated on heap.
</p>

<!--
For the standard Go compiler,
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CxgUBPlx9iJzkz9JWkb6tIpTe5q32QDmz8l0BouG0Cw/preview

very large memory blocks will always be allocated on heap?
https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20021

The values referenced by values allocated on heap will never be allocated in stacks.
-->

<div>
In fact, stacks are not essential for Go programs.
Go compiler/runtime can allocate all memory block on heap.
Supporting stacks is just to make Go programs run more efficiently:
<ul>
<li>
	allocating memory blocks on stacks is much faster than on heap.
</li>
<li>
	memory blocks allocated on a stack don't need to be garbage collected.
</li>
<li>
	stack memory blocks are more CPU cache friendly than heap ones.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
If a memory block is allocated somewhere, we can also say the value parts hosted
on the memory block are allocated on the same place.
</p>

<p>
If a value part used in a function is allocated on heap,
we can say the value part escapes to heap.
By using the official Go SDK, we can run <code>go build -gcflags -m</code> to check
which local values (value parts) will escape to heap at run time.
As above has mentioned, the current escape analyzer in the standard Go compiler
is still not perfect, many local value parts can be allocated on stacks safely
will still escape to heap.
</p>

<p>
When a local variable value of type <code>T</code> escapes to heap,
what that really means is that Go runtime also creates
an implicit pointer of type <code>*T</code> on the stack of the current goroutine.
The value of the pointer stores the address of the memory block allocated on heap
(a.k.a., the address of the local variable of type <code>T</code>).
Go compiler has already replaced all references to the variable to
the deferences of the pointer value at compile time.
</p>

<p>
Direct parts of global variables (package-level variables) will never be allocated on stacks.
Whether or not they will be allocated in heap is compiler dependent.
A value part referenced by the direct part of any global variable and any value part allocated
on heap will be allocated on heap if the value part is not the direct part of a global variable.
Direct parts of global variables and value parts allocated on heap will never
reference value parts allocated on stacks.
Value parts allocated on a stack can only be referenced by value parts allocated on the same stack.
</p>

<div>
Some facts:
<ul>
<li>
	if a field of a struct value escapes to heap,
	then the whole struct value will also escape to heap.
</li>
<li>
	if an element of an array value escapes to heap,
	then the whole array value will also escape to heap.
</li>
<li>
	if an element of a slice value escapes to heap,
	then all the elements of the slice will also escape to heap.
</li>
<li>
	if a non-nil slice value escapes to heap,
	then its elements will also escape to heap.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
A memory block created by calling <code>new</code> function may be allocated on heap or stacks.
This is different to C++.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="when-can-collect"></p>
<h3>When Can A Memory Block Be Collected?</h3>

<p>
Memory blocks allocated for direct parts of global variables will never be collected.
</p>

<p>
Each stack will be collected as a whole when the corresponding goroutine exits.
So there is no need to collect the memory blocks allocated on stacks, individually, one by one.
Stacks are not collected by the garbage collector.
</p>

<p>
For a memory block allocated on heap, it can be safely collected only when
it is no longer referenced (either directly or indirectly)
by any direct part of global values and any value part allocated on goroutine stacks.
We call such memory blocks as unused memory blocks.
Here the global values include not only explicit package-level variables,
but also some runtime internal global values.
Unused memory blocks on heap will be collected by the garbage collector.
</p>

<div>
Here is an example to show when some memory blocks can be collected:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

var p *int

func main() {
	done := make(chan bool)
	// done will be used on the main and the following
	// new goroutine, so it will be allocated on heap.
	
	go func() {
		x, y, z := 123, 456, 789
		_ = z  // z can be allocated on stack safely.
		p = &x // For x and y are referenced by global p,
		p = &y // so they will be both allocated on heap.
		// Now, x is not referenced by anyone, so
		// its memory block can be collected now.
		p = nil
		// Now, y is als not referenced by anyone,
		// so its memory block can be collected now.
		
		done <- true
	}()
	
	<- done
	// Now the above goroutine exits, the done channel
	// is not used any more, a smart compiler will
	// think it can be collected now.
	
	// ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

Sometimes, smart compilers, such as the standard Go compiler,
may make some optimizations so that some references
are removed earlier than we expect. Here is such an example.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	bs := make([]int, 1000000)
	
	// A smart compiler can detect that the underlying part of the
	// slice bs will never be used later, so that the underlying
	// part of the slice bs can be garbage collected safely now.

	fmt.Println(len(bs))
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Please read <a href="value-part.html">value parts</a> to learn the
internal structures of slice values.
</p>

<p>
By the way, sometimes, we may hope the slice <code>bs</code> is guaranteed
to not being garbage collected after the <code>fmt.Println</code> call,
then we can use a <code>runtime.KeepAlive</code> function call to tell
garbage collectors that the slice <code>bs</code> is still used.
</p>

For example,

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "runtime"

func main() {
	bs := make([]int, 1000000)

	fmt.Println(len(bs))
	runtime.KeepAlive(&bs) // runtime.KeepAlive(bs) is also
	                       // okay for this specified example.
}
</code></pre>

<p>
<code>runtime.KeepAlive</code> function calls are often needed
if <a href="unsafe.html">unsafe pointers</a> are involved.
</p>

<h3>When Will A Memory Block Be Collected?</h3>

<p>
Go runtime will collect unused heap memory blocks (garbage) to reuse or release memory.
The current standard Go compiler (up to v1.11) uses
<a href="https://blog.golang.org/go15gc">a concurrent, tri-color, mark-sweep garbage collector</a>.
Here this article will not explain the detailed implementation. Just some facts are listed below.
</p>

<div>
The collector is not always running. It will start when a threshold is satisfied.
So an unused memory block may be not collected immediately after it becomes unused,
it will be collected eventually.
Currently, the threshold is controlled by
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#hdr-Environment_Variables">GOGC environment variable</a>:
<blockquote style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">
<small>
	The GOGC variable sets the initial garbage collection target percentage.
	A collection is triggered when the ratio of freshly allocated data to
	live data remaining after the previous collection reaches this percentage.
	The default is GOGC=100. Setting GOGC=off disables the garbage collector entirely.
</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
The value of this environment variable determines the frequency of garbage collecting,
and it can <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/debug/#SetGCPercent">be modified at run time</a>.
Smaller values lead to more frequent garbage collections.
Go programs can also run the collector explicitly by calling the
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#GC">runtime.GC</a> function.
</p>
</div>

<div>
In the mark phase, the collector uses the tri-color algorithm mentioned above to analyze
which memory blocks are unused:
<blockquote style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">
<small>
	At the start of a GC cycle all objects are white.
	The GC visits all roots, which are objects directly accessible by the application
	such as globals and things on the stack, and colors these grey.
	The GC then chooses a grey object, blackens it, and then scans it for pointers to other objects.
	When this scan finds a pointer to a white object, it turns that object grey.
	This process repeats until there are no more grey objects.
	At this point, white objects are known to be unreachable and can be reused.
</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here, <b><i>objects</i></b> are either value parts or memory blocks.
</p>

<p>
The unused memory blocks will be swept at the sweep phase.
</p>
</div>

<!--
<p>
There is a stop-the-world phase in garbage collecting. All goroutines must be paused in this phase.
After many improvements from version to version,
since v1.8, the collector makes typical worst-case stop-the-world duration less than 100μs (0.1 millisecond).
This generally removes noticeable lags at run time.
</p>
-->

<p>
The collector is a non-compacting one, so it will not move memory blocks to rearrange them.
</p>

<!--
<p>
A memory block may not be released to OS immediately after it is collected,
so that it can be reused in another memory block allocation shortly after.
Don't worry, the offical Go runtime is much less memory greedy than most Java runtimes.
</p>
-->
