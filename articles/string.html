<h1>Strings In Go</h1>

<p>
Like many programming languages, string is also one important kind of types in Go.
This article will list all the facts of strings.
</p>

<h3>The Internal Structure Of String Types</h3>

<div>
For the standard Go compiler,
the internal structure of any string type is declared like:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type _string struct {
	elements *byte // underlying bytes
	len      int   // number of bytes
}
</code></pre>
<p>
From the declaration, we know that the a string
(in the standard compiler implementation) is actually
a <code>byte</code> sequence wrapper
(or a container which elements are bytes).
</p>
</div>

<p>
Note, in Go, <code>byte</code> is a built-in alias of type <code>uint8</code>.
</p>

<h3>Some Simple Facts About Strings</h3>

<div>

We have learned the following facts about strings from previous articles.
<ul>
<li>
	String values can be used as constants (along with boolean and all kinds of numeric values).
</li>
<li>
	Go supports <a href="basic-types-and-value-literals.html#string-literals">two styles of
	string literals</a>, the double-quote style (or interpreted literals)
	and the back-quote style (or raw string literals).
</li>
<li>
	The zero values of string types are blank strings, which can be represented
	with <code>""</code> or <code>``</code> in literal.
</li>
<li>
	Strings can be concatenated with <code>+</code> and <code>+=</code> operators.
</li>
<li>
	String types are all comparable (by using the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators).
	And like integer and floating-point values, two values of the same string type can also be compared with
	<code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code> and <code>&lt;=</code> operators.
	When comparing two strings, their underlying bytes will be compared, one byte by one byte.
	If one string is a prefix of the other one and the other one is longer,
	then the other one will be viewed as the larger one.
</li>
</ul>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	const World = "world"
	var hello = "hello"
	
	// Concat strings.
	var helloWorld = hello + " " + World
	helloWorld += "!"
	fmt.Println(helloWorld) // hello world!
	
	// Compare strings.
	fmt.Println(hello == "hello")   // true
	fmt.Println(hello > helloWorld) // false
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

More facts about string types and values in Go.
<ul>
<li>
	Like Java, the contents of string values are immutable.
	Once created, their contents can't be modified.
	The lengths of string values are also immutable.
	A string value can only be overwritten as a whole by assigning another string value to it.
</li>
<li>
	String type has no methods (just like most other built-in types in Go), but
	<ul>
	<li>
		the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/strings/"><code>strings</code> standard package</a> contains many string utility functions.
	</li>
	<li>
		the built-in function <code>len</code> can be used to get the length of a string (number of bytes stored in the string).
	</li>
	<li>
		like <a href="container.html#element-accessment">element
		accessments of arrays, slices and maps</a>,
		the syntax <code>aString[i]</code> is also used to get the
		<b>i</b><i>th</i> <code>byte</code> value stored in <code>aString</code>.
		The expression <code>aString[i]</code> is not addressable.
		In other words, value <code>aString[i]</code> can't be modified.
	</li>
	<li>
		like <a href="container.html#subslice">the subslice
		syntax</a> for arrays, slices and maps,
		the syntax <code>aString[start:end]</code> is used to get a substring of <code>aString</code>.
		Here, <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> are both indexes of bytes stored in <code>aString</code>.
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
	For the standard Go compiler,
	the destination string variable and source string value in a string assignment will
	share the same underlying byte sequence in memory.
	The result of a substring expression <code>aString[start:end]</code>
	also shares the same underlying byte sequence with the original string
	<code>aString</code> in memory.
</li>
</ul>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	var helloWorld = "hello world!"
	
	var hello = helloWorld[:5] // substring
	// 104 is the ascii code (and Unicode) of char 'h'
	fmt.Println(hello[0])         // 104
	fmt.Printf("%T \n", hello[0]) // uint8
	// hello[0] = 'H'             // error: hello[0] is immutable
	// fmt.Println(&hello[0])     // error: hello[0] is not addressable
	
	fmt.Println(len(hello), len(helloWorld))          // 5 12
	fmt.Println(strings.HasPrefix(helloWorld, hello)) // true
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>String Encoding And Runes</h3>

<p>
In Go, all strings are viewed as UTF-8 encoded.
The basic units in UTF-8 encoded strings are called code points.
Most code points can be viewed as the characters we speak of in daily life.
But for a few characters, each of them is composed of several code points.
</p>

<p>
Code points are represented as rune values in Go.
The built-in <code>rune</code> type is an alias of type <code>int32</code>.
</p>

<p>
At compile time, illegal UTF-8 runes in string literals (and rune literals) will make compilation fail.
At run time, Go runtime can't prevent some bytes stored in a string from being UTF-8 illegal.
In other words, a string at run time may be ill UTF-8 encoded.
</p>

<p>
As the above has mentioned, each string is actually a byte sequence wrapper.
So each rune in a string will be stored as one or more bytes (up to four bytes).
For example, each English code point (or character) is stored as one byte in Go strings,
however each Chinese code point (or character) is stored as three bytes in Go strings.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="conversions"></p>
<h3>String Related Conversions</h3>

<div>
In the article <a href="constants-and-variables.html#explicit-conversion">constants and variables</a>,
we have learned that intergers can be explicitly converted to strings (but not vice versa).
Here introduces two more string related conversions rules in Go:
<ol>
<li>
	a string value can be explicitly converted to a byte slice, and vice versa.
	A byte slice is a slice whose underlying type is <code>[]byte</code>
	(a.k.a., <code>[]uint8</code>).
</li>
<li>
	a string value can be explicitly converted to a rune slice, and vice versa.
	A rune slice is a slice whose underlying type is <code>[]rune</code>
	(a.k.a., <code>[]int32</code>).
</li>
</ol>

<p>
In the conversions from rune slices to strings,
each slice element (a rune value) will be converted to its respective
UTF-8 encoding byte sequence representation.
If a slice element values is outside the range of valid Unicode code points,
the it will be viewed as <code>0xFFFD</code>,
the code point for the Unicode replacement character.
<code>0xFFFD</code> is represented with three bytes in UTF-8 encoding
(<code>"\uFFFD" == "\xef\xbf\xbd"</code>).
<p>

<p>
When a string is converted to a rune slice, the bytes stored in the string
will be viewed as successive UTF-8 encoding byte sequence representations
of many Unicode code points. Bad UTF-8 encoding representations will be
converted to a rune value <code>0xFFFD</code>.
</p>

<p>
When a string is converted to a byte slice,
the result byte slice is just a deep copy of
the underlying byte sequence of the string.
When a byte slice is converted to a string,
the underlying byte sequence of the result string
is also just a deep copy of the byte slice.
A memory allocation is needed to store the deep copy
in each of such conversions.
The reason why a deep copy is essential is slice elements are mutable
but the bytes stored in strings are immutable,
so a byte slice and a string can't share byte elements.
</p>


Please note, for conversions between strings and byte slices,
<ul>
<li>
	illegal UTF-8 encoded bytes are allowed and will keep unchanged.
</li>
<li>
	the standard Go compiler makes some optimiazations
	for some special cases of such conversions,
	so that the deep copies are not made.
	Such optimiazations will be introduced below.
</li>
</ul>

Conversions between byte slices and rune slices are not supported directly in Go,
We can use the following ways to achieve this purpose:
<ul>
<li>
	use string values as a hop. This way is convenient but not very efficient.
</li>
<li>
	use the functions in <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/utf8/">unicode/utf8</a> standard package.
</li>
<li>
	we can use <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/bytes/#Runes">the
	<code>Runes</code> function in the bytes standard package</a>
	to convert a <code>[]byte</code> value to a <code>[]rune</code> value.</li>
</ul>



Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"unicode/utf8"
)

func Runes2Bytes(rs []rune) []byte {
	n := 0
	for _, r := range rs {
		n += utf8.RuneLen(r)
	}
	n, bs := 0, make([]byte, n)
	for _, r := range rs {
		n += utf8.EncodeRune(bs[n:], r)
	}
	return bs
}

func main() {
	s := "Color Infection is a fun game."
	bs := []byte(s) // string -> []byte
	s = string(bs)  // []byte -> string
	rs := []rune(s) // string -> []rune
	s = string(rs)  // []rune -> string
	rs = bytes.Runes(bs) // []byte -> []rune
	bs = Runes2Bytes(rs) // []rune -> []byte
}
</code></pre>

<!--
https://github.com/golang/go/issues/23536
todo: if later the meaning of "byte slice" is changed.
      The beginning of this article may be also
      need changed. "a <code>byte</code> sequence" should be changed
      to "a byte sequence".
-->

Maybe it is not intentional, for the standard Go compiler
(at least up to v1.11),
it looks a string can also be converted to a slice type whose
element type's underlying type is <code>byte</code>,
but not vice versa.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	type MyByte byte
	str := "hello"
	bs := []MyByte(str) // compile okay
	str = string(bs)    // error: cannot use []MyByte as []byte
}

<h3>Compiler Optimizations For Conversions Between Strings And Byte Slices</h3>

<div>
Above has mentioned that the underlying bytes in the conversions
between strings and byte slices will be copied.
The current standard Go compiler (v1.11) will make some optimizations
for some special scenarios to avoid the duplicate copies.
These scenarios include:
<ul>
<li>
	a conversion (from string to byte slice) which
	follows the <code>range</code> keyword in a <code>for-range</code> loop.
</li>
<li>
	a conversion (from byte slice to string) which is used as a map key.
</li>
<li>
	a conversion (from byte slice to string) which is used in a comparison.
</li>
<li>
	a conversion (from byte slice to string) which is used in
	a string concatenation, and at least one of concatenated
	string values is a non-blank string constant.
</li>
</ul>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var str = "world"
	// Here, the []byte(str) conversion will not copy
	// the underlying bytes of str.
	for i, b := range []byte(str) {
		fmt.Println(i, ":", b)
	}
	
	key := []byte{'k', 'e', 'y'}
	m := map[string]string{}
	// Here, the string(key) conversion will not copy the bytes
	// in key. The optimization will be still made even if key
	// is a package-level variable.
	m[string(key)] = "value"
	fmt.Println(m[string(key)]) // value
}
</code></pre>

Another example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "testing"

var s string
var x = []byte{1024: 'x'}
var y = []byte{1024: 'y'}

func fc() {
	// None of the below 4 conversions will
	// copy the underlying bytes of x and y.
	if string(x) != string(y) {
		s = (" " + string(x) + string(y))[1:]
	}
}

func fd() {
	// Only the two conversions in the comparison
	// will not copy the underlying bytes of x and y.
	if string(x) != string(y) {
		s = string(x) + string(y)
	}
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(testing.AllocsPerRun(1, fc)) // 1
	fmt.Println(testing.AllocsPerRun(1, fd)) // 3
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3><code>for-range</code> On Strings</h3>

<div>
<p>
The <code>for-range</code> loop control flow applies to strings.
But please note, <code>for-range</code> will iterate the Unicode code points
(as <code>rune</code> values), instead of bytes, in a string.
Bad UTF-8 encoding representations in the string will be
interpreted as <code>rune</code> value <code>0xFFFD</code>.
</p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := "éक्षिaπ汉字"
	for i, rn := range s {
		fmt.Printf("%v: 0x%x %v \n", i, rn, string(rn))
	}
}
</code></pre>

The output of the above program:
<pre>
0: 0x65 e
1: 0x301 ́
3: 0x915 क
6: 0x94d ्
9: 0x937 ष
12: 0x93f ि
15: 0x61 a
16: 0x3c0 π
18: 0x6c49 汉
21: 0x5b57 字
</pre>
Please note:
<ol>
<li>the index value may be not continuous, for one code point may need more than one bytes to represent.</li>
<li>the first character, <code>é</code>, is composed of two runes (3 bytes total)</li>
<li>the second character, <code>क्षि</code>, is composed of four runes (12 bytes total).</li>
<li>the English character, <code>a</code>, is composed of one rune (1 byte).</li>
<li>the character, <code>π</code>, is composed of one rune (2 bytes).</li>
<li>each of the two Chinese characters, <code>汉字</code>, is composed of one rune (3 bytes each).</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
Then how to iterate bytes in a string? Do this:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := "éक्षिaπ汉字"
	for i := 0; i < len(s); i++ {
		fmt.Printf("The byte at index %v: 0x%x \n", i, s[i])
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
As you have seen, <code>len(s)</code> will return the number of bytes in strings.
The time complexity of <code>len(s)</code> is <code><i>O</i>(1)</code>.
How to get the number of runes in a string?
Using <code>for-range</code> to iterate and count all runes is a way, and using the
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/utf8/#RuneCountInString">RuneCountInString</a>
function in the <code>unicode/utf8</code> standard package is another way.
The efficiencies of the two ways are almost the same.
Please note that the time complexities of both ways are <code><i>O</i>(n)</code>.

<!--
todo: len([]rune(str))
   https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24923
-->
</p>
</div>

<div>
Surely, we can also make use of the compiler optimization mentioned above to iterate bytes in a string.
For the standard Go compiler, this way is a little more efficient than the above one.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := "éक्षिaπ汉字"
	for i, b := range []byte(s) { // here, the underlying bytes are not copied.
		fmt.Printf("The byte at index %v: 0x%x \n", i, b)
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>
</p>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="string-concatenation"></p>
<h3>More String Concatenation Methods</h3>

<div>
Besides using the <code>+</code> operator to concatenate strings, you can also use following methods to concatenate strings.
<ul>
<li>
	The <code>Sprintf</code>/<code>Sprint</code>/<code>Sprintln</code> functions
	in the <code>fmt</code> standard package
	can be used to concatenate values of any types, including string types.
</li>
<li>
	Use the <code>Join</code> function in the <code>strings</code> standard package.
</li>
<li>
	The <code>Buffer</code> type in the <code>bytes</code> standard package
	(or the built-in <code>copy</code> function) can be used to build byte slices,
	which afterwards can be converted to string values.
</li>
<li>
	Since Go 1.10, the <code>Builder</code> type in the <code>strings</code> standard package
	can be used to build strings. This method avoids making an unnecessary duplicated copy
	of underlying bytes of the result string.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Go standard compiler makes optimizations for string concatenations by using the <code>+</code> operator.
So generally, using <code>+</code> operator to concatenate strings is convenient and efficient
if the number of the concatenated strings is known at compile time.
</p>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="use-string-as-byte-slice"></p>
<h3>Sugar: Use Strings As Byte Slices</h3>

<div>

<p>
From the article <a href="container.html">arrays, slices and maps</a>,
we have learned that we can use the built-in <code>copy</code> and
<code>append</code> functions to copy and append slice elements.
In fact, as a special case,
if the type of the first argument of a call to either of the two
functions is a byte slice, then the second argument can be a string
(if the call is an <code>append</code> call, then the string argument
must be followed by three dots <code>...</code>).
In other words, a string can be used as a byte slice for the special case.
</p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	hello := []byte("Hello ")
	world := "world!"
	
	// helloWorld := append(hello, []byte(world)...) // the normal way
	helloWorld := append(hello, world...)            // the sugar way
	fmt.Println(string(helloWorld))
	
	helloWorld2 := make([]byte, len(hello) + len(world))
	copy(helloWorld2, hello)
	// copy(helloWorld2[len(hello):], []byte(world)) // the normal way
	copy(helloWorld2[len(hello):], world)            // the sugar way
	fmt.Println(string(helloWorld2))
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="comparison"></p>
<h3>More About String Comparisons</h3>

<div>
Above has mentioned that comparing two strings is comparing their underlying bytes in fact.
Most compilers will made some optimizations for string comparisons.
<ul>
<li>
	If the lengths of the compared two strings are not equal,
	then the two strings must be also not equal.
</li>
<li>
	If their underlying byte sequence pointers of
	the compared two strings are equal,
	then the comparison result is the same as
	comparing the lengths of the two strings.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So for two equal strings, the time complexity of comparing them
depends on whether or not their underlying byte sequence pointers are equal.
If the two equal string values don't share the same underlying bytes,
then the time complexity of comparing the two values is <code><i>O</i>(n)</code>,
where <code>n</code> is the length of the two strings,
otherwise, the time complexity is <code><i>O</i>(1)</code>.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
As above mentioned, for the standard Go compiler, in a string value assignment,
the destination string value and the source string value will
share the same underlying byte sequence in memory.
So after the assignment, the cost of comparing
the two strings becomes very small.
</p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	bs := make([]byte, 1<<26)
	s0 := string(bs)
	s1 := string(bs)
	s2 := s1
	
	// s0, s1 and s2 are three equal strings.
	// The underlying bytes of s0 is a copy of bs.
	// The underlying bytes of s1 is also a copy of bs.
	// The underlying bytes of s0 and s1 are two different copies of bs.
	// s2 shares the same underlying bytes with s1.

	startTime := time.Now()
	_ = s0 == s1
	duration := time.Now().Sub(startTime)
	fmt.Println("duration for (s0 == s1):", duration)
	
	startTime = time.Now()
	_ = s1 == s2
	duration = time.Now().Sub(startTime)
	fmt.Println("duration for (s1 == s2):", duration)
}
</code></pre>

Output:
<pre class="output"><code>duration for (s0 == s1): 10.462075ms
duration for (s1 == s2): 136ns
</code></pre>

<p>
1ms is 1000000ns! So please try to avoid comparing two long strings
if they don't share the same underlying byte sequence.
</p>
</div>
