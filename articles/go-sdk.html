<h1>The Official Go SDK</h1>

<p>
Currently, the tools in the official Go SDK are the most used tools to develop Go projects.
In Go 101 article series, all examples are compiled and verified with the standard Go compiler.
</p>

<p>
This article will introduce how to setup the Go development environment
and how to run simple Go programs.
Some tools of the official Go SDK will also be introduced.
</p>

<h3>Install Go SDK</h3>

<p>
Please <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">download</a> the official Go SDK
and install it according the instructions shown in the download page.
</p>

<p>
The version of an official Go SDK release is consistent with
the highest Go language verison the release supports.
For example, the lastest Go SDK 1.11.x supports all Go language versions from 1.0 to Go 1.11.
</p>

<p>
The path to the <code>bin</code> subfolder in the Go SDK installation root path
must be put in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable to execute the tools
(mainly the <code>go</code> subcommands) in the SDK without inputting their full paths.
If your Go SDK is installed with an installer or by a package manager, the path to
the <code>bin</code> subfolder may have been already set in the <code>PATH</code>
environment variable automatically for you.
</p>

<p>
Earlier Go SDK versions may require <code>GOROOT</code> and <code>GOPATH</code> environment variables to be set.
The latest Go SDK has no such requirements.
The default value of the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable is
the path to the <code>go</code> folder under the home directory of the current user.
<code>GOPATH</code> environment variable may list multiple paths.
</p>

<!--
<p><i>
(Before Go SDK 1.9, a <code>GOROOT</code> environment variable had to be configured
as the root path of the SDK installation.
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.9#goroot">With Go SDK 1.9</a>,
this environment variable became optional, and it is recommended to leave it unset.)
</i></p>

<p>
Before Go SDK 1.8, a <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable must be set.
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.8#gopath">Since Go SDK 1.8</a>,
the default value of this environment variable is the path of the <code>go</code>
folder under the home directory of the current user.
You may specify <code>GOPATH</code> manually in order to work with one (or more) different location(s).
Yes, the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable may list multiple paths.
</p>

<p>
It is highly recommended to add the <code>bin</code> subfolder of the very first path specified in
the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable to the <code>PATH</code> environment variable as this allows to run
some third-party Go programs
due to the <code>go install</code> command putting
any resulting executables into this <code>bin</code> subfolder of the first path.
</p>

<p>
Before Go SDK 1.11, it is recommended to put all custom Go packages
into the <code>src</code> subfolder of any path specified
in the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable,
especially when a Go project depends on some third party packages.
Packages will be introduced in the
<a href="packages-and-imports.html">packages and imports</a> article.
</p>

<p>
The tools in Go SDK 1.11 support versioned packages (experimentally).
So, since Go SDK 1.11, your Go packages can be freely put in any folder.
You need to put a <code>go.mod</code> file in a package folder
and specify the import path of the package in that file.
You can get more module releated information from
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules">this wiki page</a>.
</p>

<p>
All examples in Go 101 articles are so simple that
the example files can be put in any folder,
even if they are compiled with the compilers in Go SDKs before version 1.11.

<h3>The Simplest Go Program</h3>

<div>
<p>
Let's write a simple exmaple and learn how to run simple Go programs.
</p>

The following program is the simplest Go program.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The words <code>package</code> and <code>func</code> are two keywords.
The two <code>main</code> words are two identifiers.
Keywords and identifiers are introduced in
<a href="keywords-and-identifiers.html">a coming article</a>.
</p>

<p>
The first line <code>package main</code> specifies the package name
(<b>main</b> here) of the source file.
</p>

<p>
The second line is a blank line for better readability.
</p>

<p>
The remaining code declares a function
which is also called <code>main</code>.
This <code>main</code> function in a <code>main</code> package
specifies the entry point of a program.
(Note that some other user code might be executed
before the <code>main</code> function becomes invoked.)
</p>

</div>

<h3>Run a Go Program</h3>

<div>

<p>
The official Go SDK requires that Go source code file
to have the extension <code>.go</code>.
Here, we assume the above source code is saved in a file
named <code>simplest-go-program.go</code>.
</p>

Open a terminal and change the current directory to the directory
which contains the above source file, then run
<pre class="output"><code>$ go run simplest-go-program.go
</code></pre>

<p>
Nothing is output? Yes, this program outputs nothing.
</p>

<p>
If there are some syntax errors in the source code,
then these errors will be reported as compilation errors.
</p>

Note: If multiple source files are
in the <code>main</code> package of a program,
then we should run the program with the following command
<pre class="output"><code>$ go run *.go
</code></pre>

<p>
Note, the <code>go run</code> command is not recommended
to compile and run large Go projects.
It is just a convenient way to run simple Go programs,
like the ones in the Go 101 articles.
For large Go projects,
use the commands <code>go build</code> or <code>go install</code>
instead.
</p>

<h3>More <code>go</code> Subcommands</h3>

<p>
The three commands, <code>go run</code>, <code>go build</code> and <code>go install</code>,
will only show code syntax errors (if any).
They don't (try to) show code warnings (a.k.a, possible code logic mistakes).
We can use the <code>go vet</code> command to check and report such warnings.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go fmt</code> command to format Go source code
with a consistent coding style.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go get</code> command to clone and checkout
a remote third-party go package repository.
<code>go get</code> requires the corresponding version control tool must be installed.
If the command succeeds, the third-party go package will be put in
the <code>src</code> folder under the first path specified
in the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go test</code> command to run tests and benchmarks.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go doc</code> command to view Go documentations in terminal windows.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go help aSubCommand</code> command to view the help message for a specified sub command.
</p>

<p>
Since Go SDK 1.11, we can use the <code>go mod</code> command to package dependencies.
Please run <code>go help mod</code> for more details.
</p>

<p>
The <code>go</code> command run without any arguments
shows the supported subcommands.
</p>

<p>
The Go 101 article series will not explain much more on how to use the tools
provided by the official Go SDK.
Please read the <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/">official documentations</a> for details.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="doc"></p>
<h3>View Go Documentations In Browsers</h3>

<p>
We can view all kinds of Go documentations at the official Go
website <a href="https://golang.org">golang.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
We can also run <code>godoc -http=:9999</code> to start a local clone of the
official website at <a href="http://localhost:9999">localhost:9999</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please note that, for Go SDK 1.10, if the <code>GOROOT</code> environment variable is unset,
we must specify the <code>goroot</code> flag when running the local godoc server,
e. g. <code>godoc -http=:9999 -goroot path/to/go/sdk</code>.
This inconvenience is caused by a bug in Go SDK 1.10.
This bug has been fixed in Go SDK 1.11.
</p>

<p>
Currently (Go SDK 1.11), the <code>godoc</code> command doesn't support showing documentations
of packages outside of the paths specified in the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable.
</p>

<p>
The <code>godoc</code> command tries to list the documentations of all the packages
under the paths specified in the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable.
If you only want to view the documentations of the standard packages,
you can set the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable to a non-exist path
before running <code>godoc</code>, e. g. <code>GOPATH=nonexist godoc -http=:9999</code>.
</p>
