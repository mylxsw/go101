<h1>Expression Evaluation Orders</h1>

<p>
This article will explain <a href="expressions-and-statements.html">expression</a>
evaluation orders in all kinds of scenarios.
</p>

<h3>An Expresssion Is Evaluated After The Expressions It Depends On</h3>

<div>
This is easy to comprehend.
An apparent example is an expression is evaluated later than its sub-expressions.
For example, in a function call <code>f(x, y[n])</code>,
<ul>
<li>
	<code>f()</code> is evaulated later than its depended expressions,
	including <code>f</code>, <code>x</code> and <code>y[n]</code>.
</li>
<li>
	the evalation of the expression <code>y[n]</code> is later than
	the evaluations of <code>n</code> and <code>y</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please read <a href="packages-and-imports.html#initialization-order">program resoruce initialization order</a>
for another example on package-level variable initialization orders.
</p>

</div>

<h3>The Usual Order</h3>

<div>

For the evaluations within a function body, Go specification says

<div class="alert alert-success">
...,
when evaluating the operands of an expression, assignment, or return statement,
all function calls, method calls, and (channel) communication operations
are evaluated in lexical left-to-right order. 
</div>

<p>
The just described order is called <b><i>the usual order</i></b>.
</p>

<p>
Please note that an explicit value conversion <code>T(x)</code> is not a function call.
</p>

For example, in an expression <code>[]int{x, fa(), fb(), y}</code>,
assume <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are two variables,
<code>fa</code> and <code>fb</code> are two functions, then the call <code>fa()</code>
is guaranteed to be evaluated before <code>fb()</code>.
However, the following the evaluation orders are unspecified in Go specification:
<ul>
<li>
	the evaluation order of <code>x</code> (or <code>y</code>) and <code>fa()</code> (or <code>fb()</code>).
</li>
<li>
	the evaluation order of <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>fa</code> and <code>fb</code>.
</li>
</ul>

Another example, the following assignment, is demoed in Go specification.

<pre><code class="language-go">y[z.f()], ok = g(h(a, b), i()+x[j()], <-c), k()
</code></pre>

where
<ul>
<li>
	<code>c</code> is a channel expression and will be evaluation to a channel value.
</li>
<li>
	<code>g</code>, <code>h</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>j</code> and <code>k</code>
	are function expressions.
</li>
<li>
	<code>f</code> is a method of expression <code>z</code>.
</li>
</ul>

Also considering the rule mentioned in the last section, compilers should guarantee the following evaluation orders at run time.
<ul>
<li>
	The function calls, method calls and channel communication operations
	happen in the order <code>z.f()</code>, <code>h()</code>, <code>i()</code>,
	<code>j()</code>, <code>&lt;-c</code>, <code>g()</codE>, and <code>k()</code>.
</li>
<li>
	<code>h()</code> is evaluated after the evaluations of expressions <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
</li>
<li>
	<code>y[]</code> is evaluated after the evaluation of <code>z.f()</code>.
</li>
<li>
	<code>z.f()</code> is evaluated after the evaluation of expression <code>z</code>.
</li>
<li>
	<code>x[]</code> is evaluated after the evaluation of <code>j()</code>.
</li>
</ul>

However, the following orders (and more others) are not specified.
<ul>
<li>
	The evaluation order of <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>, <code>g</code>,
	<code>h</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>x</code>,
	<code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>c</code> and <code>k</code>.
</li>
<li>
	The evaluation order of <code>y[]</code>, <code>x[]</code> and <code>&lt;-c</code>.
</li>
</ul>

By the above introduced rules, we know the following delcared variables <code>x</code>,
<code>m</code> and <code>n</code> (also demoed in Go specification)
will be initialized with ambiguous values.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">	a := 1
	f := func() int { a++; return a }

	// x may be [1, 2] or [2, 2]: evaluation order 
	// between a and f() is not specified.
	x := []int{a, f()}

	// m may be {2: 1} or {2: 2}: evaluation order
	// between the two map assignments is not specified.
	m := map[int]int{a: 1, a: 2}

	// n may be {2: 3} or {3: 3}: evaluation order
	// between the key and the value is not specified.
	n := map[int]int{a: f()}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h3>Evaluation Orders In Assignment Statements</h3>

<div>

Beside the usual order, Go specification specifies more on the expression evaluation order in an assignment:

<div class="alert alert-success">
The assignment proceeds in two phases.
First, the operands of index expressions and pointer indirections
(including implicit pointer indirections in selectors) on the left
and the expressions on the right are all evaluated in the usual order.
Second, the assignments are carried out in left-to-right order.
</div>

<p>
Later, we call the first phase as evaluation phase and the second phase as carry-out phase.
At the evaluation phase, all expressions involved in that assignment are evaluated
by the rules mentioned in last two sections.
</p>

<p>
Go specification doesn't specify clearly how the operands in the mentioned expressions
on the left should be exactly evaluated, which ever caused
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/23188#issuecomment-403951267">some</a>
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15620">disputes</a>.
So, hrere, this article will explain more on the evaluation orders in value assignments.
<p>

<p>
To make the following explanations convenient,
if the map value of a map index destination expression in an assignment is a not addressable,
we can think the map value has already been saved in and replaced by a temporary addressable map value
before executing the assignment.
</p>

In the end of the evaluation phase, just before the carry-out phase starts,
each destination expression on the left of an assignment
will be further evaluated as its elementary form.
Different destination expressions have different elementary forms.
<ul>
<li>
	If a destination expression is a blank identifier, then its elementary form is still a blank identifier.
</li>
<li>
	If a destination expression is a map index expression <code>m[k]</code>,
	then its elementary form is <code>(*maddr)[k]</code>,
	where <code>maddr</code> is the address of <code>m</code>.
</li>
<li>
	For other cases, the destination expression must be addressable,
	then its elementary form is a dereference to the address of the destination expression.
</li>
</ul>

Assume <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are two addressable variables of the same type, the following assignment

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">	a, b = b, a
</code></pre>

will be executed like the following steps:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// The evaluation phase:
P0 := &a; P1 := &b
R0 := a; R1 := b

// The elementary form: *P0, *P1 = R0, R1

// The carry-out phase:
*P0 = R0
*P1 = R1
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

Here is another example, in which <code>x[0]</code> instead of <code>x[1]</code> is modified.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">	x := []int{0, 0}
	i := 0
	i, x[i] = 1, 2
	fmt.Println(x) // [2 0]
</code></pre>

The decomposed execution steps for the line <i>3</i> shown below are like:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// The evaluation phase:
P0 := &i; P1 := &x[0];
R0 := 1; R1 := 2

// The elementary form: *P0, *P1 = R0, R1

// The carry-out phase:
*P0 = R0
*P1 = R1
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

An example which is a little more complex.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	m := map[string]int{"Go": 0}
	s := []int{1, 1, 1}; olds := s
	n := 2
	p := &n
	s, m["Go"], *p, s[n] = []int{2, 2, 2}, s[1], m["Go"], 5
	fmt.Println(m, s, n) // map[Go:1] [2 2 2] 0
	fmt.Println(olds)    // [1 1 5]
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

The decomposed execution steps for the line <i>10</i> shown below are like:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// The evaluation phase:
P0 := &s; PM1 := &m; K1 := "Go"; P2 := p; P3 := &s[2]
R0 := []int{2, 2, 2}; R1 := s[1]; R2 := m["Go"]; R3 := 5
// now, R1 == 1, R2 == 0

// The elementary form: *P0, (*PM1)[K1], *P2, *P3 = R0, R1, R2, R3

// The carry-out phase:
*P0 = R0
(*PM1)[K1] = R1
*P2 = R2
*P3 = R3
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

The following example rotates all elements in a slice for one index.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">	x := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11}
	t := x[0]
	var i int
	for i, x[i] = range x {}
	x[i] = t
	fmt.Println(x) // [3 5 7 11 2]
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

Another example:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">	x := []int{123}
	x, x[0] = nil, 456        // will not panic
	x, x[0] = []int{123}, 789 // will panic
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Although it is legal, it is not recommanded to use complex multi-value assignments in Go,
for their readabilities are not good and they have negative effects on both complication speed and execution performance.
</p>

Not all orders are specified in Go specification for value assignments,
so some bad written code may result different results.
In the following example, the expression order of
<code>x+1</code> and <code>f(&x)</code> is not specified.
So the example may print <code>100 99</code> or <code>1 99</code>.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	f := func (p *int) int {
		*p = 99
		return *p
	}
	
	x := 0
	y, z := x+1, f(&x)
	fmt.Println(y, z)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

The following is another example which will print ambiguous results. 
It may print <code>1 7 2</code>, <code>1 8 2</code> and <code>1 9 2</code>,
depending on different compiler implementations.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	x, y := 0, 7
	f := func() int {
		x++
		y++
		return x
	}
	fmt.Println(f(), y, f())
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h3>Expression Evaluation Orders In <code>switch-case</code> Code Blocks</h3>

<div>

The expression evaluation order in a <code>switch-case</code> code block has been
<a href="control-flows.html#switch-case">described before</a>.
Here just shows an example.
Simply speaking, before a branch code block is entered, the case expressions
will evaluated and compared with the switch expression one by one,
until a comparation results <code>true</code>.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	f := func(n int) int {
		fmt.Printf("f(%v) is called.\n", n)
		return n
	}
	
	switch x := f(3); x + f(4) {
	default:
	case f(5):
	case f(6), f(7), f(8):
	case f(9), f(10):
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
At run time, the <code>f()</code> calls will be evaluated by the order
from top to bottom and from left to right,
until a comparison results <code>true</code>.
So <code>f(8)</code>, <code>f(9)</code> and <code>f(10)</code>
will be not evaluated in this example.
</p>

The output:
<pre class="output"><code>f(3) is called.
f(4) is called.
f(5) is called.
f(6) is called.
f(7) is called.
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h3>Expression Evaluation Orders In <code>select-case</code> Code Blocks</h3>

<div>

<p>
For all the cases in a <code>select-case</code> code block,
the channel operands of receive operations and the channel and
right-hand-side expressions of send statements are evaluated exactly once,
in source order, upon starting executing the <code>select</code> statement.
</p>

<p>
The left-hand-side expression of each receive case operation will only be
evaluated if that receive operation is selected.
The left-hand-side expressions of the unselected receive statements
will never be evaluated.
</p>

In the following example, the expression <code>*fptr("aaa")</code> will never be evaluated,
for its corresponding receive operation <code>fchan("bbb", nil)</code> will not be selected.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	c := make(chan int, 1)
	c <- 0
	fchan := func(info string, c chan int) chan int {
		fmt.Println(info)
		return c
	}
	fptr := func(info string) *int {
		fmt.Println(info)
		return new(int)
	}
	
	select {
	case *fptr("aaa") = <-fchan("bbb", nil): // blocking
	case *fptr("ccc") = <-fchan("ddd", c):   // non-blocking
	case fchan("eee", nil) <- *fptr("fff"):  // blocking
	case fchan("ggg", nil) <- *fptr("hhh"):  // blocking
	}
}
</code></pre>

The output of the above program:
<pre class="output"><code>bbb
ddd
eee
fff
ggg
hhh
ccc
</code></pre>

<p>
Note that the expression <code>*fptr("ccc")</code> is the last evaluated expression in the above example.
It is evaluated after its corresponding receive operation <code>&lt;-fchan("ddd", c)</code> is selected.
</p>

</div>
