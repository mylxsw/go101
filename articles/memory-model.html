<h1>Memory Order Guarantees In Go</h1>

<h3>About Memory Ordering</h3>

<p>
Modern compilers (at compile time) and CPU processors (at run time)
often make some optimizations by adjusting the instruction orders,
so that the instruction execution orders may differ from the
orders presented in code.
</p>

<p><i>
(Instruction reordering is also often called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_ordering">memory ordering</a>.)
</i></p>

<p>
Surely, instruction reorderings are not arbitrary.
The basic requirement for a reordering inside a specified goroutine is
the reordering must not be detectable by the gorotuine itself
if the goroutine doesn't share data with other goroutines.
In other words, from the perspective of such a goroutine,
it can think its instruction execution order is always
the same as the order specified by code,
even if there are really some instruction reorderings happening inside it.
</p>

<p>
However, if some goroutines share some data,
instruction reorderings happen inside one of these goroutine
may be observed by the others goroutines,
and affact the behaviors of all these goroutines.
Sharing data between goroutines is common in concurrent programming,
if we ignore the results caused by instruction reordering,
the behaviors of our concurrent programs might compiler and CPU dependent,
and often abnormal.
</p>

<div>
Here is an unprofessional Go program which doesn't consider instruction reordering.
the program is expanded from an example in
<a href="https://golang.org/ref/mem">Go 1 memory model</a>.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "runtime"

var a string
var done bool

func setup() {
	a = "hello, world"
	done = true
}

func main() {
	go setup()

	for !done {
		runtime.Gosched()
	}
	println(a) // expect to print: hello, world
}
</code></pre>

The behavior of this program is very possible as we expect,
a <code>hello, world</code> text will be printed.
However, the behavior of this program is compiler and CPU dependent.
If the program is compiled with a different compiler,
or it runs on a different architecture,
it may print nothing, or a text different from <code>hello, world</code>.
The reason is compilers and CPUs may exchange the execution orders of the two lines
in the <code>setup</code> function,
so the final effect of the <code>setup</code> function may become to
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func setup() {
	done = true
	a = "hello, world"
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>setup</code> goroutine in the above program will not observe the reordering,
however, the main goroutine will.
</p>

<p>
Besides the reordering problem, there are data races in the program.
There are not any synchronizations made in accessing the variable
<code>a</code> and <code>done</code>.
So, the above program is a showcase full of concurrent programming mistakes.
A professional Go programmer should not make these mistakes.
</p>

<h3>Go Memory Model</h3>

<p>
Sometimes, we need to ensure that the execution of some code lines in a goroutine
must happen before (or after) the execution of some code lines in another goroutine,
to keep the correctness of a program.
Instruction reorderings may cause some troubles for such circumstances.
How should we do to prevent some possible instruction reorderings?
</p>

<p>
Different CPU architectures provide different fence instructions
to prevent different kinds of instruction reorderings.
Some programming languages provide corresponding functions
to insert these fence instructions in code.
However, understanding and correctly using the fence instructions
raises the bar of concurrent programming.
</p>

<p>
The design philosophy of Go is to use as fewer features as possible
to support as more use cases as possible, at the same time to
ensure a good enough overall code execution efficiency.
So Go built-in and standard packages don't provide direct ways
to use the CPU fence instructions.
In fact, in Go, we can use some kinds of the synchronization methods
in Go to ensure expected code execution orders.
</p>

<p>
Following will list some guaranteed (and non-guaranteed) code execution orders,
which are mentioned or not mentioned in
<a href="https://golang.org/ref/mem">Go 1 memory model</a> and other official Go documentations.
</p>

<p>
In the following descriptions, if we say
event <code>A</code> is guaranteed to happen before event <code>B</code>,
it means any of the goroutines involved in the two events will observe that
any of the statements presented before event <code>A</code> in source code
will be executed before
any of the statements presented after event <code>B</code> in source code.
For other irrelevant goroutines,
the observed orders may be different from the just described.
</p>

<h4><code>init</code> Functions Related Order Guarantees</h4>

<div>
Go memory model mentions the two <code>init</code> functions related order guarantees:
<ul>
<li>
	the completion of all the <code>init</code> functions in the dependency packages of a package
	happens before the start of any <code>init</code> function in the package.
</li>
<li>
	the completion of all <code>init</code> functions in a program
	happens before the start of the program <code>main</code> entry function.
</li>
</ul>

In fact, there is two other order guarantees:
<ul>
<li>
	the completion of all package-level variable initializations in a package
	happens before the start of any <code>init</code> function in the package.
</li>
<li>
	the completion of all the <code>init</code> functions in the dependency packages of a package
	happens before any package-level variable initialization in the package.
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p class="anchor" id="goroutine"></p>
<h4>The Creation Of A Goroutine Happens Before The Execution Of The Goroutine</h4>

<div>
In the following function,
the assignment <code>x, y = 123, 789</code> will be executed before the call <code>fmt.Println(x)</code>,
and the call <code>fmt.Println(x)</code> will be executed before the call <code>fmt.Println(y)</code>.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">var x, y int
func f1() {
	x, y = 123, 789
	go func() {
		fmt.Println(x)
		go func() {
			fmt.Println(y)
		}()
	}()
}
</code></pre>

However, the executon orders of the three in the following function are not deterministic.
There are data races in this function.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">var x, y int
func f2() {
	go func() {
		fmt.Println(x) // might print 0, 123, or some others.
	}()
	go func() {
		fmt.Println(y) // might print 0, 789, or some others.
	}()
	x, y = 123, 789
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="channel"></p>
<h4>Channel Related Order Guarantees</h4>

<div>
The following listed guarantees are not mentioned in Go 1 memory model,
but I think they are obvious.
<ul>
<li>
	A channel send operation happens before the completion of the send operation.
</li>
<li>
	A channel receive operation happens before the completion of the receive operation.
</li>
<li>
	The completions of two send operations on a channel can't happen at the same time.
</li>
<li>
	The completions of two receive operations on a channel can't happen at the same time.
</li>
</ul>

Go 1 memory model lists the following three channel related order guarantees.
<ol>
<li>
	The <b>n</b>th successful send to a channel happens before
	the <b>n</b>th successful receive from that channel completes,
	no matter that channel is buffered or unbuffered.
</li>
<li>
	The <b>n</b>th successful receive from a channel with capacity <b>m</b>
	happens before the (<b>n+m</b>)th send to that channel completes.
	In particular, if that channel is unbuffered (m == 0),
	the <b>n</b>th successful receive from that channel happens
	before the <b>n</b>th successful send on that channel completes.
</li>
<li>
	The closing of a channel happens before a receive completes if
	the receive returns a zero value because the channel is closed.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Please note, all above order guarantees are made for the involved goroutines.
For other irrelevant goroutines,
the observed orders may be different from the above described.
</p>

Here is an example show some guaranteed code execution orders
in using an unbuffered channel.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func f() {
	var a, b int
	var c = make(chan bool)

	go func() {
		a = 1
		c <- true
		if b != 1 { // impossible
			panic("b != 1") // will never happen
		}
	}()

	go func() {
		b = 1
		<-c
		if a != 1  { // impossible
			panic("a != 1") // will never happen
		}
	}()
}
</code></pre>

Here, for the two new created goroutines, the following orders are guaranteed:
<ul>
<li>
	the assignment <code>b = 1</code> absolutely happens
	before the condition evaluation <code>b != 1</code>.
</li>
<li>
	the assignment <code>a = 1</code> absolutely happens
	before the condition evaluation <code>a != 1</code>.
</li>
</ul>

So the two calls to <code>panic</code> in the above example will never get executed.
However, the <code>panic</code> calls in the following example may get executed.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func f() {
	var a, b, x, y int
	c := make(chan bool)

	go func() {
		a = 1
		c <- true
		x = 1
	}()

	go func() {
		b = 1
		<-c
		y = 1
	}()

	// Many data races are in this goroutine.
	// Don't write code as such.
	go func() {
		if x == 1 {
			if a != 1 { // possible
				panic("a != 1") // may happen
			}
			if b != 1 { // possible
				panic("b != 1") // may happen
			}
		}

		if y == 1 {
			if a != 1 { // possible
				panic("a != 1") // may happen
			}
			if b != 1 { // possible
				panic("b != 1") // may happen
			}
		}
	}()
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Here, for the third goroutine,
which is irrelevant to the operations on channel <code>c</code>,
will not be guaranteed to observe the orders observed by the first two new created goroutines.
So, any of the four <code>panic</code> calls may get executed.
</p>

<p>
In fact, most compiler implementations do guarantee the four <code>panic</code> calls
in the above example will never get executed,
however, none of the Go official documentations make such guarantees.
So the code in the above example is not cross-compiler or cross-compiler-version compatible.
We should stick to the Go official documentations to write professional Go code.
</p>

Here is an example using an unbuffered channel.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func f() {
	var k, l, m, n, x, y int
	c := make(chan bool, 2)

	go func() {
		k = 1
		c <- true
		l = 1
		c <- true
		m = 1
		c <- true
		n = 1
	}()

	go func() {
		x = 1
		<-c
		y = 1
	}()
}
</code></pre>

The following orders are guaranteed:
<ul>
<li>
	the execution of <code>k = 1</code> happens before
	the execution of <code>y = 1</code>.
</li>
<li>
	the execution of <code>x = 1</code> happens before
	the execution of <code>n = 1</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The execution of <code>x = 1</code> is not guaranteed to happen before
the execution of <code>l = 1</code> and <code>m = 1</code>,
and the execution of <code>l = 1</code> and <code>m = 1</code>
is not guaranteed to happen before the execution of <code>y = 1</code>.
</p>

The following is an example on channel closing.
In this example, the execution of <code>k = 1</code>
is guaranteed to happen before the execution of <code>y = 1</code>,
but not guaranteed to happen before the execution of <code>x = 1</code>,
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func f() {
	var k, x, y int
	c := make(chan bool, 1)

	go func() {
		c <- true
		k = 1
		close(c)
	}()

	go func() {
		<-c
		x = 1
		<-c
		y = 1
	}()
}
</code></pre>

<!--
The two guarantees may be not true.

There are two other obvious channel related order guarantees.
But they are not very valuable for Go programming in pratice.
<ol>
<li>
	The completion of the <b>n</b>th successful send on a channel happens before
	the completion of the (<b>n+1</b>)th successful send on the channel.
</li>
<li>
	The completion of the <b>n</b>th successful receive on a channel happens before
	the completion of the (<b>n+1</b>)th successful receive on the channel.
</li>
</ol>
-->

</div>

<p class="anchor" id="mutex"></p>
<h4>Mutex Related Order Guarantees</h4>

<div>
Followings are the mutex related order guarantees in Go.
<ol>
<li>
	For an addressable value <code>l</code> of type <code>Mutex</code> or <code>RWMutex</code>
	in the <code>sync</code> standard package, the <b>n</b>th successful call of
	<code>l.Unlock()</code> happens before the (<b>n+1</b>)th successful call of
	<code>l.Lock()</code> returns.
</li>
<li>
	For an addressable value <code>l</code> of type <code>RWMutex</code>,
	if a call of <code>l.Lock()</code> has returned successfully, then the next
	successful call of <code>l.Unlock()</code> will happen before the return
	of any call of <code>l.RLock()</code> which has not started or returned yet.
</li>
<li>
	For an addressable value <code>l</code> of type <code>RWMutex</code>,
	if the <b>n</b>th successful call of <code>l.RLock()</code> has returned,
	then the <b>m</b>th successful call of <code>l.RUnlock()</code>,
	where <code>m &lt;= n</code>, happens before the return of any call of
	<code>l.Lock()</code> which has not started or returned yet.
</li>
</ol>

In the following exanmple, the following orders are guaranteed:
<ul>
<li>
	the execution of <code>a = 1</code> happens before
	the execution of <code>b = 1</code>.
</li>
<li>
	the execution of <code>m = 1</code> happens before
	the execution of <code>n = 1</code>.
</li>
<li>
	the execution of <code>x = 1</code> happens before
	the execution of <code>y = 1</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func fab() {
	var a, b int
	var l sync.RWMutex

	l.Lock()
	go func() {
		l.Lock()
		b = 1
		l.Unlock()
	}()
	go func() {
		a = 1
		l.Unlock()
	}()
}

func fmn() {
	var m, n int
	var l sync.RWMutex

	l.RLock()
	go func() {
		l.Lock()
		n = 1
		l.Unlock()
	}()
	go func() {
		m = 1
		l.RUnlock()
	}()
}

func fxy() {
	var x, y int
	var l sync.RWMutex

	l.Lock()
	go func() {
		l.RLock()
		y = 1
		l.RUnlock()
	}()
	go func() {
		x = 1
		l.Unlock()
	}()
}
</code></pre>
</div>


<h4>Order Guarantees Made By <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> Values</h4>

<p>
Assume at a given time, the counter maintained by
an addressable <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> value <code>wg</code> is not zero,
and after the given time, a <code>wg.Add</code> (or <code>wg.Done</code>) method call
and a <code>wg.Wait</code> method call are made.
As long as we can confirm that the counter never becomes to zero
before the <code>wg.Add</code> (or <code>wg.Done</code>) method call returns
(and after the given time),
the <code>wg.Add</code> (or <code>wg.Done</code>) method call
is guaranteed to happen before
any <code>wg.Wait</code> method call made after the given time returns.
</p>

<p>
Please read <a href="concurrent-synchronization-more.html#waitgroup">the explanations
for sync.WaitGroup</a> to get how to use <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> values.
</p>

<h4>Order Guarantees Made By <code>sync.Once</code> Values</h4>

<p>
For an addressable <code>sync.Once</code> value <code>o</code>,
among all the <code>o.Do</code> calls, only exact one argument function will be invoked.
The invoked argument function is guaranteed to return before
any <code>o.Do</code> method call returns.
In other words, the code in the invoked argument function
is guaranteed to be executed before any <code>o.Do</code> method call returns.
</p>

<p>
Please read <a href="concurrent-synchronization-more.html#once">the explanations
for sync.Once</a> to get how to use <code>sync.Once</code> values.
</p>

<h4>Order Guarantees Made By <code>sync.Cond</code> Values</h4>

<p>
It is some hard to make a clear discription for
the order guarantees made by an addressable <code>sync.Cond</code> value <code>c</code>.
Simply put, if a <code>c.Wait()</code> call is guaranteed to be resumed
by a <code>c.Notify</code> (or <code>c.Broadcast</code>) call,
then the <code>c.Notify</code> (or <code>c.Broadcast</code>) call is guaranteed to
happen before the <code>c.Wait()</code> call returns.
</p>

<p>
Please read <a href="concurrent-synchronization-more.html#cond">the explanations
for sync.Cond</a> to get how to use <code>sync.Cond</code> values.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="atomic"></p>
<h4>Atomic Related Order Guarantees</h4>

<div>
<p>
All above mentioned synchronization techniques make some memory order guarantees.
These guarantees are well documented in all kinds of Go official documentations.
However, none of Go official documentations mentions what memory order guarantees
are made by the atomic synchronization technique.
</p>

In fact, in the implementation of the standard Go compiler,
at least up to Go SDK 1.11,
there are exactly some memory order guarantees made by atomic operations.
The standard Go runtime relies extensively on the guarantees provided by atomic operations.
For example, the following program always prints <code>1</code>,
if it is compiled with the standard Go compiler 1.11.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "sync/atomic"
import "runtime"

func main() {
	var a, b int32 = 0, 0

	go func() {
		atomic.StoreInt32(&a, 1)
		atomic.StoreInt32(&b, 1)
	}()

	for {
		if n := atomic.LoadInt32(&b); n == 1 {
			// The following line always prints 1.
			fmt.Println(atomic.LoadInt32(&a))
			break
		}
		runtime.Gosched()
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Here, the main goroutine will always observe that the modification
of <code>a</code> happens before the modification of <code>b</code>.
</p>

<p>
However, the guarantees made by atomic operations are not
written down in the Go specification and other offcial Go documentations.
If you want to write cross-compiler and cross-compile-version compatible Go code,
the safe advice is,
<b>don't rely on atomic to guarantee memory orderings in general Go programming</b>.
There is <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/5045">an issue</a>
on how these guarantees should be written down.
But, up to now (Go 1.11), the decision has not been made.
</p>

<p>
Please read <a href="concurrent-atomic-operation.html">this article</a>
to get how to do atomic operations.
</p>

For the complexity and subtlety of properly using atomic functions, atomic functions are not recommanded
to synchronize values. Mutexes are more preferred.
Some Go team members are regreted that the atomic package is expose as a public standard package
and think the atomic package should only be used inside standard pckages and runtime code.

Cmd/compile: Go 1.8 regression: sync/atomic loop elided

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/AoO3aivfA_E/zFjhu8XvngMJ
We generally don’t want sync/atomic to be used at all
Experience has shown us again and again that
very very few people are capable of writing correct code
that uses atomic operations…If we had thought of internal packages
when we added the sync/atomic package, perhaps we would have used that.
Now we can’t remove the package because of the Go 1 guarantee.
