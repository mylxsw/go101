<h1>Type-Unsafe Pointers</h1>

<p>
We have learned Go pointers from the article
<a href="pointer.html">pointers in Go</a>.
From that article, we know that, comparing to C pointers,
there are many restrictions made for Go pointers.
For example, Go pointers can't participate arithmetic operations.
And for two arbitrary pointer types, it is very possible that
their values can't be converted to each other.
</p>

<p>
The pointers explained in that article are called type-safe pointers actually.
Although the restrictions on type-safe pointers really make
us be able to write safe Go code with ease,
they also make some obstacles to write efficient code in some scenarios.
</p>

<p>
In fact, up to currrent (Go 1.11), Go also supports type-unsafe pointers,
which are pointers without the restrictions made for safe pointers.
Type-unsafe pointers are also called unsafe pointers in Go.
Go unsafe pointers are much like C pointers,
they are powerful, and also dangerous.
For some scenarios, we can write more efficient code
with the help of unsafe pointers.
On the other hand, it is easy to write invalid code which is subtle
and difficult to detect when using unsafe pointers.
</p>

<p>
The biggest risk of using unsafe pointers comes from the fact that
the unsafe mechanism is not protected by
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1compat">the Go 1 compatibility guidelines</a>.
Code depending on unsafe pointers works today could break
since a later Go version.
</p>

<p>
If you really desire the code efficient improvements by using unsafe
pointers for any reason, not only should you know the above mentioned risks,
but also should you follow the instructions written in official Go
documentations and clearly understand the effects of each unsafe pointer use,
so that you can write safe Go code with unsafe pointers,
at least if you use the standard Go compiler in Go SDK 1.11.
</p>

<h3>About The <code>unsafe</code> Standard Package</h3>

<div>
Go provides a special kind of types for unsafe pointers.
We must import
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/">the <code>unsafe</code> standard package</a>
to use unsafe pointers.
The <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> type is defined as

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type Pointer *ArbitraryType
</code></pre>

<p>
Surely, it is not a usual type definition.
Here the <code>ArbitraryType</code>
just hints that a <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> value can be converted
to any safe pointer values in Go, and vice versa.
In other words, <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> is like the <code>void*</code> in C.
</p>

<p>
Go unsafe pointers mean the types
whose underlying types are <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>.
</p>

<p>
The zero values of unsafe pointers are also represneted with
the predelcared identifier <code>nil</code>.
</p>

The <code>unsafe</code> standard package also provides three functions.
<ul>
<li>
	<code>func Alignof(variable ArbitraryType) uintptr</code>,
	which is used to get the address alignment of a value.
	Please notes, the aligns for struct-field values and non-field values
	of the same type may be different, though for the standard
	Go compiler, they are always the same.
	
</li>
<li>
	<code>func Offsetof(selector ArbitraryType) uintptr</code>,
	which is used to get the address offset of a field in a struct value.
	The offset is relative to the address of the struct value.
	The return results should be always the same for the same corresponding
	fields of the struct values of the same type in the same program.
</li>
<li>
	<code>func Sizeof(variable ArbitraryType) uintptr</code>,
	which is used to get the size of a value
	(a.ka.a, the size of the type of the value).
	The return results should be always the same
	for all values of the same type in the same program.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that the types of the return results of the three functions are all
<code>uintptr</code>. Below we will learn that <code>uintptr</code> values
can be converted to <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>, and vice versa.
<p>

<p>
Although the return results of the three functons
are consistent in the same program,
they may be different crossing operation systems of different architectures,
crossing compilers, and crossing compiler versions.
</p>

<p>
Calls to the three function are always evaluated at compile time.
Their results can be assigned to constants.
</p>

An example of using the three functions.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "unsafe"

func main() {
	var x struct {
		a int64
		b bool
		c string
	}
	const M, N = unsafe.Sizeof(x.c), unsafe.Sizeof(x)
	fmt.Println(M, N)   // 16 32
	
	fmt.Println(unsafe.Alignof(x.a)) // 8
	fmt.Println(unsafe.Alignof(x.b)) // 1
	fmt.Println(unsafe.Alignof(x.c)) // 8
	
	fmt.Println(unsafe.Offsetof(x.a)) // 0
	fmt.Println(unsafe.Offsetof(x.b)) // 8
	fmt.Println(unsafe.Offsetof(x.c)) // 16
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Please note, the above print results are for the standard
Go compiler 1.11 on Linux amd64 OSes.
</p>

<h3>The Warnings From Go Official Documentation</h3>

<div>

The <code>unsafe</code> package documentation
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#pkg-overview">says</a>:

<div class="alert alert-success">
Packages that import <code>unsafe</code> may be non-portable
and are not protected by the Go 1 compatibility guidelines.
</div>

And the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1compat">Go 1 compatibility guidelines</a> says:
<div class="alert alert-success">
Packages that import <code>unsafe</code> may depend on internal properties of the Go implementation.
We reserve the right to make changes to the implementation that may break such programs.
</div>

However, Ian, one of the core member of Go team,
has <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=topic/golang-nuts/Pi7VveWDUPc">confirmed</a>:
<ul>
<li>
	the signatures of the functions in <code>unsafe</code> package
	will not change in future Go 1 versions,
</li>
<li>
	and the <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> type will
	always there in future Go 1 versions.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So, the three functions provided in the <code>unsafe</code> package
don't look much dangerous.
Rob Pike, the Go project leader, even
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/5602">made a proposal to move
the three functions to elsewhere</a>.
The only unsafety of these functions is their calls
may return different values for later versions of Go compilers.
</p>

<p>
Most of the unsafty of the <code>unsafe</code> package comes unsafe pointers.
They are as dangerous as C pointers, which is Go always tries to avoid.
</p>

</div>
-->

<h3>Unsafe Pointers Related Conversion Rules</h3>

<div>
Go compilers allow the following explicit conversions.
<ul>
<li>
	A safe pointer can be explicitly converted to an unsafe pointer,
	and vice versa.
</li>
<li>
	An uintptr value can be explicitly converted to an unsafe pointer,
	and vice versa.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
By using these conversions, we can do conversions
between any two safe pointers, between any two uintptr values,
and between an arbitrary safe pointer and an uintptr value.
Unsafe pointers act as bridges in these conversions.
</p>

<p>
However, although these conversions are all legal at compile time,
not all of them are valid (safe) at run time.
These conversions defeat the memory safety the whole Go type system
(except the unsafe part) tries to maintain.
We must follow the instructions listed in a later section below
to write valid Go code with unsafe pointers.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Some Facts In Go We Should Know</h3>

<p>
Before introducing the valid unsafe pointer use patterns,
we need to know some facts in Go.
</p>

<h4>Fact 1: Unsafe Pointers Are Pointers And Uintptr Values Are Intergers</h4>

<p>
Each of non-nil safe and unsafe pointers references another value.
However uintptr values don't reference any values, they are just plain integers,
though often each of them stores a memory address.
</p>

<p>
Go is a language supporting automatic garbage collection.
When a Go program is running, Go runtime will
<a href="memory-block.html#when-to-collect">check which values are not used
any more and collect the memory</a> allocated for these unused values,
from time to time.
Pointers play an important role in the check process.
If a value is unreachable from (referenced by) any values still in using,
then Go runtime thinks it is an unuse value and it can be safely garbage collected.
</p>

<p>
As uintptr values are integers, they can participate arithmetic operations.
</p>

<p>
The example in the next subsection shows the differences between
pointers and uintptr values.
</p>

<h4>Fact 2: Unused Values May Be Collected At Any Time</h4>

<div>
<p>
At run time, the garbage collector may run at any time,
so when a value becomes unused, the
<a href="memory-block.html">memory block</a> allocated for unused values may be
<a href="memory-block.html#when-can-collect">collected at any time</a>.
</p>

For example:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "unsafe"

var x *int
var y unsafe.Pointer
var z uintptr

func main() {
	var vx, vy, vz int
	x = &vx
	y = unsafe.Pointer(&vy)
	z = uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&vz))
	
	// At the time, even if its address of vz is stored in z.
	// vz has already become unused. Gargage collector can
	// collect the memory allocated for it now.
	// On the other hand. vx and vy are still in using,
	// for they are reachable from the x and y pointers.
	
	// uinptr can be used as operands of arithmetic operators.
	z++
	z &^= 1 // <=> z = z &^ 1
	
	fmt.Println(x, y, z)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h4>Fact 3: We Can Use A <code>runtime.KeepAlive</code> Function Call To Mark A Value As Still In Using (Reachable) Currently</h4>

<div>
<p>
To mark a value still reachable, we should pass another value which references
the value as the argument a <code>runtime.KeepAlive</code> function call.
A pointer to the value is often used as such an argument.
</p>

In the following code, a small modification is made on the example in the last subsection.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func main() {
	var vx, vy, vz int
	x = &vx
	y = unsafe.Pointer(&vy)
	z = uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&vz))
	
	// do other things ...
	
	// vz is still reachable at least up to here, so
	// it will not be garbage collected now for sure.
	runtime.KeepAlive(&vz)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h4>Fact 4: <code>*unsafe.Pointer</code> Is A General Safe Pointer Type</h4>

<div>
<p>
Yes, <code>*unsafe.Pointer</code> is a safe unnamed pointer type.
Its base type is <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>.
As it is a safe pointer, accroding the conversion rules listed above,
it can be converted to <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> type, and vice versa.
</p>

For example:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "unsafe"

func main() {
	x := 123 // of type int
	p := unsafe.Pointer(&x)
	pp := &p // of type *unsafe.Pointer
	p = unsafe.Pointer(pp)
	pp = (*unsafe.Pointer)(p)
}
</code></pre>

</div>

<h3>How To Use Unsafe Pointers Correctly</h3>

<p>
The <code>unsafe</code> standard package documentation lists
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#Pointer">six unsafe pointer use patterns</a>.
Following will introduce and explain them one by one.
</p>

<h4>Pattern 1: Convert <code>*T1</code> To Unsafe Poniter, Then Convert The Unsafe Pointer Value To <code>*T2</code></h4>

<div>

<p>
As above has mentioned, by using the unsafe pointer conversion rules above,
we can convert a value of <code>*T1</code> to type <code>*T2</code>,
where <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> are two arbitrary types.
However, we should only do such conversions if the size of <code>T1</code>
is no larger than <code>T2</code>, and only if the conversions are meaningful.
</p>

<p>
As a result, we can also achieve the conversions between
type <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> by using this pattern.
</p>

One example is the <code>math.Float64bits</code> function,
which converts a <code>float64</code> values to an <code>uint64</code> value.
Each corresponding bit of the memory representations
of the two values is identical.
The <code>math.Float64bits</code> function does reverse conversions.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func Float64bits(f float64) uint64 {
	return *(*uint64)(unsafe.Pointer(&f))
}

func Float64frombits(b uint64) float64 {
	return *(*float64)(unsafe.Pointer(&b))
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Please note, the return result of the <code>Float64bits(aFloat64)</code>
function is different from the result of the explicit conversion
<code>uint64(aFloat64)</code>.
</p>

In the following example, we use this pattern to convert a <code>[]MyString</code>
slice to type <code>[]string</code>, and vice versa.
The result slice and the original slice share the underlying elements.
Such conversions are impossible through safe ways,

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

func main() {
	type MyString string
	ms := []MyString{"C", "C++", "Go"}
	fmt.Printf("%s\n", ms)  // [C C++ Go]
	// ss := ([]string)(ms) // compiling error
	ss := *(*[]string)(unsafe.Pointer(&ms))
	ss[1] = "Rust"
	fmt.Printf("%s\n", ms) // [C Rust Go]
	// ms = []MyString(ss) // compiling error
	ms = *(*[]MyString)(unsafe.Pointer(&ss))
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h4>Pattern 2: Convert Unsafe Pointer To Uintptr, Then Use The Uintptr Value</h4>

<div>
<p>
This parttern is not very useful.
Usually, we print the result uintptr values to check the memory addresses
stored in them. However, there are other less verbose ways to this job.
So this pattern is not much useful.
</p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "unsafe"

func main() {
	type T struct{a int}
	var t T
	fmt.Println(&t)                                 // &{0}
	fmt.Printf("%x\n", uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&t))) // c6233120a8
	println(&t)                                     // 0xc6233120a8
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Abviously, it is more simple to use the built-in function
<code>println</code> to print an address.
</p>
</div>

<h4>Pattern 3: Convert Unsafe Pointer To Uintptr, Do Arithmetic Operations With The Uintptr Value, Then Convert Back</h4>

<div>

For example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "unsafe"

type T struct {
	x bool
	y [3]int16
}

const N = unsafe.Offsetof(T{}.y)
const M = unsafe.Sizeof([3]int16{}[0])

// We use a package-level channel variable to make sure the T
// value used in the main function will be allocated on heap.
var c = make(chan *T, 1)

func main() {
	c <- &T{y: [3]int16{123, 456, 789}}
	t := <-c
	p := unsafe.Pointer(t)
	// "uintptr(p) + N + M + M" stores the address of t.y[2].
	ty2 := (*int16)(unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(p) + N + M + M))
	fmt.Println(*ty2) // 789
}
</code></pre>

<p>
For this specified example, the conversions are not much useful.
It is just a demo for education purpose.
</p>

Please note, for this specified example,
the above conversion line from <code>uintptr</code> to
<code>unsafe.Pointer</code> shouldn't be split into two lines,
like the following code shows.
Please read the comments in the code for the reason.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">...
	p := unsafe.Pointer(t)
	// Now the t value becomes unused, its memory may
	// be garbage collected at this time. So the following
	// use of the address of t.y[2] may be invalid!
	addr := uintptr(p) + N + M + M
	ty2 := (*int16)(unsafe.Pointer(addr))
	fmt.Println(*ty2)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Such bugs are so subtle and hard to detect,
which is why the uses of unsafe pointers are dangerous.
</p>

If we do want to split that conversion line into two lines,
we should call the <code>runtime.KeepAlive</code> function and
pass the unsafe pointer <code>p</code> as the argument.
after the use of the address of <code>t.y[2]</code>. Like this

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">...
	p := unsafe.Pointer(t)
	addr := uintptr(p) + N + M + M
	ty2 := (*int16)(unsafe.Pointer(addr))
	fmt.Println(*ty2)
	// This following line assures the memory of the value
	// t will not get garbage collected currently for sure.
	runtime.KeepAlive(p)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Another detail to note is that,
it is not recommended to store the end boundry of a memory block
in a pointer (either safe or unsafe one).
Doing this will prevent another memory block which closely follows
the former memory block from being garbage collected.
</p>

</div>

<h4>Pattern 4: Convert Unsafe Pointer To <code>uintptr</code> When Calling <code>syscall.Syscall</code></h4>

<div>

From the explanations for the last pattern,
we know that the following function is dangerous.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// Assume this function will not inlined.
func DoSomething(addr uintptr) {
	// read or write values at the passed address ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The reason why the above function is dangerous is that the function
itself can't guarantee the values at the passed argument address
are not garbage collected yet.
In fact, there may be some new values which have been allocated
at the passed argument address.
</p>

However, the prototype of the <code>Syscall</code> function in
the <code>syscall</code> standard package is as
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func Syscall(trap, a1, a2, a3 uintptr) (r1, r2 uintptr, err Errno)
</code></pre>

<p>
How does this function guarantee that the values at the passed addresses
<code>a1</code>, <code>a2</code> and <code>a3</code> are still not garbage
collected yet within the function internal?
The function can't guarantee this.
In fact, compilers will make the guarantee.
It is the privilege of calls to <code>syscall.Syscall</code> alike functions.
</p>

We can think that, compilers will append a <code>runtime.KeepAlive</code> call
for each of <code>uintptr</code> arguments, like the folowing code shows:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">syscall.Syscall(SYS_READ, uintptr(fd), uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(p)), uintptr(n))
// Compilers will automatically append the following lines for the above line.
runtime.KeepAlive(unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(fd)))
runtime.KeepAlive(unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(p))))
runtime.KeepAlive(unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(n)))
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Although the <code>syscall.Syscall</code> function has this privilege,
there is a requirement to call this function.
The conversions from unsafe pointers to <code>uinptr</code> must be present
within the literal representations of the arguments of the calls to this function.
</p>

For example, the following call is invalid if the <code>p</code>
is not guaranteed to be still used after the call.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">u := uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(p))
syscall.Syscall(SYS_READ, uintptr(fd), u, uintptr(n))
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Again, never use this pattern when calling other functions.
We should append the <code>runtime.KeepAlive</code> calls manually
when calling other functions with <code>uintptr</code> parameters.
</p>

</div>

<h4>Pattern 5: Convert The <code>uintptr</code> Result Of <code>reflect.Value.Pointer</code> Or <code>reflect.Value.UnsafeAddr</code> Method Call To Unsafe Pointer</h4>

<div>

<p>
The methods <code>Pointer</code> and <code>UnsafeAddr</code> of the
<code>Value</code> type in the <code>reflect</code> standard package
both return a result of type <code>uintptr</code> instead of
<code>unsafe.Pointer</code>.
This is a deliberate design, which is to avoid converting the results of calls
(to the two methods) to any safe poiner types
without importing the <code>unsafe</code> standard package.
</p>

<p>
The design requires the return result of a call to either of the two methods
must be converted to an unsafe pointer immediately after making the call.
Otherwise, there will be small time window in which the value allocated at the
address stored in the result might lose all references and be garbage collected.
</p>

For example, the following call is valid.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">p := (*int)(unsafe.Pointer(reflect.ValueOf(new(int)).Pointer()))
</code></pre>

One the other hand, the following call is invalid.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">u := reflect.ValueOf(new(int)).Pointer()
p := (*int)(unsafe.Pointer(u))
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h4>Pattern 6: Convert A <code>reflect.SliceHeader.Data</code> Or <code>reflect.StringHeader.Data</code> Field To Unsafe Pointer, And The Inverse.</h4>

<div>
<p>
For the same reason mentioned in the last subsection, the <code>Data</code> fields
of the struct type <code>SliceHeader</code> and <code>StringHeader</code> in
the <code>reflect</code> standard package are declared with type
<code>uintptr</code> instead of <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>.
</p>

<p>
It is valid to convert a pointer to a string to a <code>StringHeader</code> pointer,
so that we can manipulate the internal of the string.
The same, it is valid to convert a pointer to a slice to a <code>SliceHeader</code> pointer,
so that we can manipulate the internal of the slice.
</p>

An example of using <code>reflect.StringHeader</code>:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "unsafe"
import "reflect"

func main() {
	a := [...]byte{'G', 'o', 'l', 'a', 'n', 'g'}
	s := "Java"
	hdr := (*reflect.StringHeader)(unsafe.Pointer(&s))
	hdr.Data = uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&a))
	hdr.Len = len(a)
	fmt.Println(s) // Golang
	// Now s and a share the same byte sequence,
	// which makes the string s become mutable.
	a[2], a[3], a[4], a[5] = 'o', 'g', 'l', 'e'
	fmt.Println(s) // Google
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

An example of using <code>reflect.SliceHeader</code>:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "unsafe"
import "reflect"
import "runtime"

func main() {
	bs := []byte("Golang")
	var pa *[2]byte // an array pointer
	hdr := (*reflect.SliceHeader)(unsafe.Pointer(&bs))
	pa = (*[2]byte)(unsafe.Pointer(hdr.Data))
	runtime.KeepAlive(&bs)
	fmt.Printf("%s\n", pa) // &Go
	pa[1] = 'a'
	fmt.Printf("%s\n", bs) // Galang
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The <code>runtime.KeepAlive</code> call is essential
if the last <code>Printf</code> line is absent.
</p>

In general,
we should only get a <code>StringHeader</code> pointer value from an actual (alreay existed) string,
or get a <code>SliceHeader</code> pointer value from an actual (alreay existed) slice.
We shouldn't do the contrary, such as creating a string from a <code>StringHeader</code>,
or creating a slice from a <code>SliceHeader</code>.
For example, the following code is invalid.


<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// Assume p points to a sequence of byte and
// n is the number of bytes in the sequence.
var hdr reflect.StringHeader
hdr.Data = uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(new([5]byte)))
// Now the just allocated byte array has lose all
// references and it can be garbage collected now.
hdr.Len = 5
s := *(*string)(unsafe.Pointer(&hdr))
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

The following is an example which shows how to convert byte slices to strings,
by using the unsafe way, and vice versa.
Different from the safe conversion from a byte slice to a string,
the unsafe way doesn't allocate a new underlying byte sequence
for the result string in each conversion.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "unsafe"
import "reflect"
import "runtime"

func ByteSlice2String(bs []byte) (str string) {
	sliceHdr := (*reflect.SliceHeader)(unsafe.Pointer(&bs))
	strHdr := (*reflect.StringHeader)(unsafe.Pointer(&str))
	strHdr.Data = sliceHdr.Data
	strHdr.Len = sliceHdr.Len
	// This KeepAlive line is essential to make the 
	// ByteSlice2String function be always valid
	// when it is provided in custom packages.
	runtime.KeepAlive(&bs)
	return
}

func main() {
	bs := []byte{'G', 'o', 'l', 'a', 'n', 'd'}
	s := ByteSlice2String(bs)
	fmt.Println(s) // Goland
	bs[5] = 'g'
	fmt.Println(s) // Golang
}

<p>
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#SliceHeader">The docs</a>
of the <code>SliceHeader</code> and <code>StringHeader</code> types in the
<code>reflect</code> standard package are similar.
The docs says the representations of the two struct types may change in a later release.
So the above example may become invalid even if the unsafe rules keep unchanged.
Fortunately, the current two avaliable Go compilers (the standard Go compiler and the gccgo compiler)
both recognise the representations of the two types declared
in the <code>reflect</code> standard package.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to convert a string to a byte slice
by using the unsafe way.
However, we should treat the result slice as
an immutable value and never modify its elements.
</p>

By the way, for the standard Go compiler, currently (Go 1.11),
there is a more efficient (and more unsafe) way to convert
a byte slice to a string.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func ByteSlice2String(bs []byte) string {
	return *(*string)(unsafe.Pointer(&bs))
}
</code></pre>

<p>
This is the implementation adopted by the <code>String</code> method
of the <code>Builder</code> type supported since Go 1.10 in the
<code>strings</code> standard package.
It makes use of the first pattern introduced above.
It is more efficient than the above one.

<h3>Final Words</h3>

<p>
From the above content, we know that, for some scenarios,
the unsafe mechanism can help us write more efficient Go code.
However, it is very easy to introduce some subtle bugs which have
very low possibilities to produce when using the unsafe mechanism.
A program with these bugs may run well for a long time,
but suddenly behave abnormally and even crash at a later time.
Such bugs are very hard to detect and debug.
</p>

<p>
We should only use the unsafe mechanism when we have to,
and we must use it with extreme care.
In particular, we should follow the instructions described above.
</p>

<p>
And again, we should aware that the unsafe mechanism introduced above
may change and even become invalid totally in later Go versions,
though no evidences this will happen soon.
If the unsafe mechanism rules change,
the above introduced valid unsafe pointer use patterns may become invalid.
So please keep it easy to switch back to the safe implementations
for you code depending on the unsafe mechanism.
</p>
