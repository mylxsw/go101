<h1>More About Deferred Function Calls</h1>

<p>
Deferred function calls have been
<a href="control-flows-more.html#defer">introduced before</a>.
Due to the limited knowledge at that time,
some more details and use cases of deferred functions calls
are not touched in that article.
These details and use cases will be touched in the remaining of this article.
</p>

<h3>Calls To Many Built-in Functions With Return Results Can't Be Deferred</h3>

<div>
<p>
In Go, the result values of a call to custom functions can be all absent (discarded).
However, for built-in functions with non-blank return result lists,
the result values of their calls mustn't be absent (up to Go 1.11), except
the calls to the built-in <code>copy</code> and <code>recover</code> functions.
We have learned that <a href="control-flows-more.html#defer">the result values
of a deferred function call must be discarded</a>,
so the calls to many built-in functions can't be deferred.
</p>

Fortunately, the needs to defer built-in function calls
(with non-blank return result lists) are rare.
As far as I know, only the calls to the built-in <code>append</code> function
may be needed to defer sometimes.
For this case, we can defer a call to an anonymous function
which wrapps the <code>append</code> call.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d"}
	defer fmt.Println(s) // [a x y d]
	// defer append(s[:1], "x", "y") // error
	defer func() {
		_ = append(s[:1], "x", "y")
	}()
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>The Evaluation Moment Of Deferred Function Values</h3>

<div>
The called function in a deferred function call may be a nil function value.
For such a case, the panic will occur before the deferred call is
pushed into the deferred call stack of the currrent goroutine. An example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer fmt.Println("reachable")
	var f func() // f is nil by default
	defer f()    // panic here
	// The following lines are dead code.
	fmt.Println("not reachable")
	f = func() {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
The argumnts of a deferred function call are
<a href="#argument-evaluation-moment">also evaluated before</a>
the deferred call is pushed into the deferred call stack
of the currrent goroutine.

<h3>Deferred Calls Make Code Cleaner And Less Bug Prone</h3>

<div>
Example:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">import "os"

func withoutDefers(filepath string, head, body []byte) error {
	f, err := os.Open(filepath)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	_, err = f.Seek(16, 0)
	if err != nil {
		f.Close()
		return err
	}

	_, err = f.Write(head)
	if err != nil {
		f.Close()
		return err
	}

	_, err = f.Write(body)
	if err != nil {
		f.Close()
		return err
	}

	err = f.Sync()
	f.Close()
	return err
}

func withDefers(filepath string, head, body []byte) error {
	f, err := os.Open(filepath)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer f.Close()

	_, err = f.Seek(16, 0)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	_, err = f.Write(head)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	_, err = f.Write(body)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	return f.Sync()
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Which one looks cleaner? apparently, the one with the deferrd calls,
though a little. And it is less bug prone,
what about if any if <code>f.Close()</code> calls in the other one is missed? ;)
</p>

The following is another example to show deferred calls can make code less bug prone.
If the <code>doSomething</code> calls panic in the following example,
the function <code>f2</code> will exit by leaving the Metex unlocked.
So the function <code>f1</code> is less bug prone.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">var m sync.Metex

func f1() {
	m.Lock()
	defer m.Unlock()
	doSomething()
}

func f2() {
	m.Lock()
	doSomething()
	m.Unlock()
}

<h3>Performance Losses Caused By Deferring Function Calls</h3>

<div>
<p>
It is not always good to use deferred function calls.
Up to now (Go 1.11), for the offical Go compiler,
deferred function calls will cause some performance losses at run time,
in particular for deferred function calls within loop code blocks.
</p>

For example, in the following example, the methods <code>CounterB</code>
and <code>IncreaseB</code> are much more efficient than the methods
<code>CounterA</code> and <code>IncreaseA</code>.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">import "sync"

type T struct {
	mu sync.Mutex
	n  int64
}

func (t *T) CounterA() int64 {
	t.mu.Lock()
	defer t.mu.Unlock()
	return t.n
}

func (t *T) CounterB() (count int64) {
	t.mu.Lock()
	count = t.n
	t.mu.Unlock()
	return
}

func (t *T) IncreaseA() {
	t.mu.Lock()
	defer t.mu.Unlock()
	t.n++
}

func (t *T) IncreaseB() {
	t.mu.Lock()
	t.n++ // this line will not panic for sure
	t.mu.Unlock()
}
</code></pre>

<p>
In the B-version functions, we should guarantee that the code between the
<code>Lock</code> and <code>Unlock</code> calls will never panic.
</p>

<p>
Generally, the A-version functions are recommended to be used in practice.
We should only adopt the B versions when we really care about
the performance of the involved functions.

<h3>Kind-Of Resource Leaking By Deferring Function Calls</h3>

<div>

A very large deferred call stack may also consume much memory.
The unexecuted deferred calls may prevent some resources from being released.
For example, if there are many files needed to be handled in a call to the following function,
then a large quantity of file handlers will be not get released in time.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func writeManyFile(files []File) error {
	for _, file := range files {
		f, err := os.Open(file.path)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
		defer f.Close()

		_, err = f.WriteString(file.content)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}

		err = f.Sync()
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
	}

	return nil
}
</code></pre>


For such cases, we can use an anonymous function to enclose the deferred calls
so that the deferred function calls will get executed earlier. For example,
the above function can be rewrittn and optimized as

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func writeManyFile(files []File) error {
	for _, file := range files {
		if err := func() error {
			f, err := os.Open(file.path)
			if err != nil {
				return err
			}
			defer f.Close()

			_, err = f.WriteString(file.content)
			if err != nil {
				return err
			}

			return f.Sync()
		}(); err != nil {
			return err
		}
	}

	return nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>
