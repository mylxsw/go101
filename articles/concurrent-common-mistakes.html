<h1>Common Concurrent Programming Mistakes</h1>

<p>
Go is a language supporting built-in concurrent programming.
By using the <code>go</code> keyword to create goroutines (light weight threads)
and by <a href="channel-use-cases.html">using</a>
<a href="channel.html">channels</a> and
<a href="concurrent-atomic-operation.html">other concurrency</a>
<a href="concurrent-synchronization-more.html">synchronization techniques</a>
provided in Go, concurrent programming becomes easy, flexible and enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
One the other hand, Go doesn't prevent Go programmers from making some
concurrent programming mistakes which are caused by either carelessnesses
or lacking of experiences.
The remaining of the current article will show some common mistakes
in Go concurrent programming, to help Go programmers avoid making such mistakes.
</p>

<h3>No Synchronizations When Synchronizations Are Needed</h3>

<div>
<p>
Code lines may be <a href="memory-model.html">not executed by the appearance orders</a>.
</p>

There are two mistakes in the following program.
<ul>
<li>
	First, the read of <code>b</code> in the main goroutine and the write
	of <code>b</code> in the new goroutine might cause data races.
</li>
<li>
	Second, the condition <code>b == true</code> can't ensure
	that <code>a != nil</code> in the main goroutine.
	Compilers and CPUs may make optimizations by
	<a href="/article/memory-model.html">reordering instructions</a>
	in the new goroutine, so the assignment of <code>b</code> may happen
	before the assignment of <code>a</code> at run time,
	which makes that slice <code>a</code> is still <code>nil</code>
	when the elements of <code>a</code> are modified in the main goroutine.
</li>
</ul>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"time"
	"runtime"
)

func main() {
	var a []int // nil
	var b bool  // false

	// a new goroutine
	go func () {
		a = make([]int, 3)
		b = true // write b
	}()

	for !b { // read b
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		runtime.Gosched()
	}
	a[0], a[1], a[2] = 0, 1, 2 // might panic
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The above program may run well on one computer, but may panic on another one.
Or it may run well for <i>N</i> times, but may panic at the <i>(N+1)</i>th time.
</p>

We should use channels or the synchronization techniques provided in
the <code>sync</code> standard package to ensure the memory orders.
For example,

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	var a []int = nil
	c := make(chan struct{})

	// a new goroutine
	go func () {
		a = make([]int, 3)
		c <- struct{}{}
	}()

	<-c
	a[0], a[1], a[2] = 0, 1, 2
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>
</div>

<h3>Use <code>time.Sleep</code> Calls To Do Synchronizations</h3>

<div>

Let's view a simple example.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	var x = 123

	go func() {
		x = 789 // write x
	}()

	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	fmt.Println(x) // read x
}
</code></pre>

<p>
We expect the program to print <code>789</code>.
If we run it, it really prints <code>789</code>, almost always.
But is it a program with good syncrhonization?
No! The reason is Go runtime doesn't guarantee the write of <code>x</code>
happens before the read of <code>x</code> for sure.
Under certain conditions, such as most CPU resources are cunsumed by
other programs running on same OS, the write of <code>x</code>
might happen after the read of <code>x</code>.
This is why we should never use <code>time.Sleep</code> calls to do
synchronizations in formal projects.
</p>

<!--
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/J3kXXZivlHA
-->

Let's view another example.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

var x = 0

func main() {
	var num = 123
	var p = &num

	c := make(chan int)

	go func() {
		c <- *p + x
	}()

	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	num = 789
	fmt.Println(<-c)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
What do you expect the program will output? <code>123</code>, or <code>789</code>?
In fact, the output is compiler dependent.
For the standard Go compiler 1.11,
it is very possible the program will output <code>123</code>.
But in theory, it might output <code>789</code>, or another unexpected number.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's change <code>c &lt;- *p + x</code> to <code>c &lt;- *p</code>
and run the program again. You will find the output becomes to <code>789</code>
(for the standard Go compiler 1.11).
Again, the output is compiler dependent.
</p>

<p>
Yes, there are data races in the above program.
The expression <code>*p</code> might be evaluated before, after, or when
the assignment <code>num = 789</code> is processed.
The <code>time.Sleep</code> call can't guarantee the evaluation of
<code>*p</code> happens before the assignment is processed.
</p>

For this specified example,
we should store the value to be sent in a temporary value
before creating the new goroutine and send the temporary value instead
in the new goroutine to remove the data races.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">...
	tmp := *p + x
	go func() {
		c <- tmp
	}()
...
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h3>Leave Goroutines Hanging</h3>

<div>
Hanging goroutines are the goroutines staying in blocking state for ever.
There are many reasons leading goroutines into hanging. For example,
<ul>
<li>
	a goroutine tries to receive a value from a nil channel or
	from a channel which no more other goroutines will send values to.
</li>
<li>
	a goroutine tries to send a value to nil channel or
	to a channel which no more other goroutines will receive values from.
</li>
<li>
	a goroutine is dead locked by itself.
</li>
<li>
	a group of goroutines are dead locked by each other.
</li>
<li>
	a goroutine is blocked when executing a <code>select</code> code block
	without <code>default</code> branch, and all the channel operations
	following the <code>case</code> keywords in the <code>select</code>
	code block keep blocking for ever.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Except sometimes we deliberately let the main goroutine in a program hanging
to avoid the program exiting, most other hanging goroutine cases are unexpected.
It is hard for Go runtime to judge whether or not a goroutine
in blocking state is hanging or stays in blocking state temporarily.
So Go runtime will never release the resources consumed by a hanging goroutine.
</p>

In the <a href="channel-use-cases.html#first-response-wins">first-response-wins</a>
channel use case, if the capacity of the channel which is used a future
is not large enough, some slower response goroutines will hang
when trying to send a result to the future channel.
For example, if the following function is called,
there will be 4 goroutines stay in blocking state for ever.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func request() int {
	c := make(chan int)
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		i := i
		go func() {
			c <- i // 4 goroutines will hang here.
		}()
	}
	return <-c
}
</code></pre>

<p>
To avoid the four goroutines hanging, the capacity of channel <code>c</code>
must be at least <code>4</code>.
</p>

In <a href="channel-use-cases.html#first-response-wins-2">the second way
to implement the first-response-wins</a> channel use case,
if the channel which is used as a future is an unbuffered channel,
it is possible that the channel receiver will never get a response and hang.
For example, if the following function is called in a goroutine,
the goroutine might hang. The reason is, if the five try-send operations
all happen before the receive operation <code>&lt;-c</code> is ready,
then all the five try-send operations will fail to send values
so that the caller goroutine will never receive a value.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func request() int {
	c := make(chan int)
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		i := i
		go func() {
			select {
			case c <- i:
			default:
			}
		}()
	}
	return <-c
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Changing the channel <code>c</code> as a buffered channel will guarantee
at least one of the five try-send operations succeed so that the caller
goroutine will never hang in the above function.
</p>

<h3>Copy Values Of The Types In The <code>sync</code> Standard Package</h3>

<div>
<p>
In practice, values of the types (except the <code>Locker</code> interface values)
in the <code>sync</code> standard package shouldn't be copied.
We should only copy pointers of such values.
</p>

The following is bad concurrent programming example.
In this example, when the <code>Counter.Value</code> method is called,
a <code>Counter</code> receiver value will be copied.
As a field of the receiver value, the respective <code>Mutex</code> field
of the <code>Counter</code> receiver value will also be copied.
The copy is not synchronized, so the copied  <code>Mutex</code> value might be corrupt.
Even if it is not corrupt, what it protects is the accessment of
the copied <code>Counter</code> receiver value, which is meaningless generally.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">import "sync"

type Counter struct {
	sync.Mutex
	n int64
}

// This method is okay.
func (c *Counter) Increase(d int64) (r int64) {
	c.Lock()
	c.n += d
	r = c.n
	c.Unlock()
	return
}

// The method is bad. When it is called, a Counter
// receiver value will be copied.
func (c Counter) Value() (r int64) {
	c.Lock()
	r = c.n
	c.Unlock()
	return
}
</code></pre>

<p>
We should change the receiver type of the <code>Value</code> method to
the poiner type <code>*Counter</code> to avoid copying <code>Mutex</code> values.
</p>

<p>
The <code>go vet</code> command provided in the official Go SDK will report
potential bad value copies.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Call Methods Of <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> At Wrong Places</h3>

<div>

<p>
Each <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> value maintains a counter internally,
The initial value of the counter is zero.
If the counter of a <code>WaitGroup</code> value is zero,
a call to the <code>Wait</code> method of the <code>WaitGroup</code> value
will not block, otherwise, the call blocks until the counter value becomes zero.
</p>

<p>
To make the uses of <code>WaitGroup</code> value meaningful,
when the counter of a <code>WaitGroup</code> value is zero,
a call to the <code>Add</code> method of the <code>WaitGroup</code> value
must happen before the corresponding call to the <code>Wait</code> method of
the <code>WaitGroup</code> value.
</p>

For example, in the following program, the <code>Add</code> method
is called at an improper place, which makes that the final printed number
is not always <code>100</code>. In fact, the final printed number of
the program may be an arbitrary number in the range <code>[0, 100)</code>.
The reason is none of the <code>Add</code> method calls are guaranteed to
happen before the <code>Wait</code> method call.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"sync/atomic"
)

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	var x int32 = 0
	for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
		go func() {
			wg.Add(1)
			atomic.AddInt32(&x, 1)
			wg.Done()
		}()
	}

	fmt.Println("To wait ...")
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println(atomic.LoadInt32(&x))
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

To make the program behave as expected, we should move the <code>Add</code>
method calls out of the new goroutines created in the <code>for</code> loop,
as the following code shown.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">...
	for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func() {
			atomic.AddInt32(&x, 1)
			wg.Done()
		}()
	}
...
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h3>Use Channels As Futures Improperly</h3>

<div>


From the article <a href="channel-use-cases.html">channel use cases</a>,
we know that some functions will return
<a href="channel-use-cases.html#future-promise">channels as futures</a>.
Assume <code>fa</code> and <code>fb</code> are two such functions,
then the following call uses future arguments improperly.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">doSomethingWithFutureArguments(<-fa(), <-fb())
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

In the above code line, the two channel receive operations are processed
sequentially, instead of concurrently.
We should modify it as the following to process them concurrently.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">ca, cb := fa(), fb()
doSomethingWithFutureArguments(<-ca, <-cb)
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h3>Close Channels Not From The Last Active Sender Goroutine</h3>

<div>

<p>
A common mistake made by Go programmers is closing a channel when there are
still some other goroutines will potentially send values to the channel later.
When such a potential send (to the closed channel) really happens,
a panic will occur.
</p>

<p>
This mistake was ever made in some famous Go projects, such as
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45291/files?diff=split">this bug</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39479/files?diff=split">this bug</a>
in the kubernetes project.
</p>

<p>
Please read <a href="channel-closing.html">this article</a> for explanations
on how to safely and gracefully close channels.
</p>

</div>


<h3>Do 64-bit Atomic Operations On Values Which Are Not Guaranteed To Be 64-bit Aligned</h3>

<div>
<p>
Up to now (Go 1.11), for the standard Go compiler, the address of the value
involved in a 64-bit atomic operation is required to be 64-bit aligned.
Failure to do so may make the current goroutine panic.
For the standard Go compiler, such failure can only happen on 32-bit architectures.
Please read <a href="memory-layout.html">memory layouts</a> to get how to
guarantee the addresses of 64-bit word 64-bit aligned on 32-bit OSes.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Not Pay Attention To Too Many Resources Are Consumed By Calls To The <code>time.After</code> Function</h3>

<div>
<p>
The <code>After</code> function in the <code>time</code> standard package
returns <a href="channel-use-cases.html#timer">a channel for delay notification</a>.
The function is convenient, however each of its calls will
create a new value of the <code>time.Timer</code> type.
The new created <code>Timer</code> value will keep alive in the duration
specified by the passed argument to the <code>After</code> function.
If the function is called many times in the duration,
there will be many <code>Timer</code> values alive
and consuming much memory and computation.
</p>

For example, if the following <code>longRunning</code> function is called
and there are millions of messages coming in one minute, then there will
be millions of <code>Timer</code> values alive in a certain period,
even if most of these <code>Timer</code> values have already become useless.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// The function will return if a message arrival interval
// is larger than one minute.
func longRunning(messages <-chan string) {
	for {
		select {
		case <-time.After(time.Minute):
			return
		case msg := <-messages:
			fmt.Println(msg)
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

To avoid too many <code>Timer</code> values being created in the above code,
we should use a single <code>Timer</code> value to do the same job.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func longRunning(messages <-chan string) {
	timer := time.NewTimer(time.Minute)
	defer timer.Stop()

	for {
		select {
		case <-timer.C:
			return
		case msg := <-messages:
			fmt.Println(msg)
			if !timer.Stop() {
				<-timer.C
			}
		}

		// The above "if" block can also be put here.

		timer.Reset(time.Minute)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h3>Use <code>time.Timer</code> Values Incorrectly</h3>

<div>
<p>
An idiomatic use example of a <code>time.Timer</code> value has been shown
in the last section.
One detail which should be noted is that the <code>Reset</code> method
should always be invoked on stopped or expired <code>time.Timer</code> values.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the first <code>case</code> branch of the <code>select</code> block,
the <code>time.Timer</code> value has expired, so we don't need to stop it.
But we must stop the timer in the second branch.
If the <code>if</code> code block in the second branch is missing,
it is possible that a send (by the Go runtime) to the channel
<code>timer.C</code> races with the <codE>Reset</code> method call,
and it is possible that the <code>longRunning</code> function returns earlier
than expected, for the <code>Reset</code> method will only reset
the internal timer to zero, it will not clear (drain) the value
which has been sent to the <code>timer.C</code> channel.
</p>

For example, the following program is very possible to exit in about one second,
instead of ten seconds. and more importantly, the program is not data race free.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	start := time.Now()
	timer := time.NewTimer(time.Second/2)
	select {
	case <-timer.C:
	default:
		time.Sleep(time.Second) // go here
	}
	timer.Reset(time.Second * 10)
	<-timer.C
	fmt.Println(time.Since(start)) // 1.000188181s
}
</code></pre>

<p>
A <code>time.Timer</code> value can be leaved in non-stopping status
when it is not used any more, but it is recommended to stop it in the end.
</p>

<p>
It is bug prone and not recommended to use a <code>time.Timer</code> value
concurrently in multiple goroutines.
</p>

<p>
We should not rely on the return value of a <code>Reset</code> method call.
The return result of the <code>Reset</code> method exists
just for compatibility purpose.
</p>
</div>
